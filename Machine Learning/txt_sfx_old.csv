Athena,Well. That was… a little unexpected.,
Athena,"Oh, who am I kidding?! That was COMPLETELY unexpected! My heart feels like it’s about to burst!",sfx-punch2.wav
Widget,Because YOU screwed up!,
Athena,WIDGET!!!,sfx-damage.wav
Athena,"Well, that isn’t exactly wrong, though, is it?",
Athena,I DID screw up. Absolutely. All because I didn’t feel I had any other choice.,
Athena,(I had no proof. I was just desperate. I couldn’t face the possibility that Turning and Scootaloo would be found guilty.),
Athena,"(But by accusing Zecora, I risked putting HER in danger. Someone who I had no reason to doubt!)",
Athena,(But that’s not the worst thing I did...),
Athena,"(I hurt Twilight, too… She tried to stop me, but I didn’t listen. And because of that, we almost LOST.)",
Athena,"(I want to say everything managed to turn out alright in the end, but that certainly wasn’t because of anything I did.)",
Athena,(It was thanks to Twilight jumping in… And Prosecutor Luna trying to guide me the whole way through…),
Athena,(... Everyone else trying to fix my one massive mistake…),
Athena,"Twilight, I-",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Twilight,"Athena, are—",
Athena,Agh… sorry. You first.,
Twilight,"No, go ahead.",
Athena,Oh… okay. H-how are you feeling?,
Twilight,I feel like I should be asking YOU that.,
Athena,"Ha, ha, well, y’know, I’m fine. I’m Athena Cykes and I’m fine!",sfx-punch2.wav
Twilight,…,
Athena,…,
Athena,It was worth a shot...,
Athena,"Okay, I’m NOT fine. Not in the slightest. But can you blame me? After what I did—I don’t know how you can even look at me right now.",
Twilight,It’s true that you made a mistake. But—,
Athena,It was more than a mistake. It was almost catastrophic!,sfx-stab2.wav
Athena,"Er, sorry. Go on.",
Twilight,"As I was saying, it’s true that you made a mistake. But you recognized that you did, and apologized for it. And Zecora accepted your apology.",
Athena,"But that doesn’t change WHAT I did, Twilight. It was stupid—it was BEYOND stupid, and I shouldn’t have done it in the first place.",sfx-damage.wav
Twilight,"W-well, I suppose it WAS a little rash…",
Athena,"The worst of it, though, was that I couldn’t fix my mistakes on my own. If it wasn’t for you and Prosecutor Luna, Turning and Scootaloo would have… they would have…",
Athena,"Let’s face it, Twilight. I’m a lousy defense attorney.",
Athena,"And after what happened there, forget not being good enough to be a lawyer. I don’t even DESERVE to be one...",
Twilight,"Oh, Athena…",
Athena,I bet Mr. Wright wouldn’t have had to do what I did.,
Phoenix,"Well, that’s not exactly true.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,B-Boss?!,sfx-punch2.wav
Twilight,P-Phoenix?!,
Athena,W-what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be with the others?,
Phoenix,"I was, but I wanted to stop by and give my compliments. You two did a great job out there, Athena, all things considered.",
Athena,"All things—Boss, are you SURE you were watching the right trial? Because I’m pretty sure I put on the WORST performance in history!",
Phoenix,"Well, it was… pretty touch-and-go for a while, admittedly.",
Phoenix,"But you kept the trial going, and gave your clients another fighting chance. I’d say that counts for something.",
Athena,"But what I said, what I did! You—you must be so ashamed of me…",
Phoenix,"Not at all, Athena. After all, I did the exact same thing the last time I was in Equestria.",sfx-huhlow.wav
Athena,W-WHAT?! You did?!,sfx-stab.wav
Phoenix,Yes.,
Athena,B-but why?,
Phoenix,…,
Phoenix,Being summoned to a new world in order to defend someone accused of murder… Just the idea alone is enough to throw anyone off their game.,
Phoenix,"Even so, I approached that trial like I would any other back in the day, and that naïveté cost me greatly.",
Phoenix,I was completely unprepared. Maybe more than I’d ever been. I was no match for the prosecution’s case against Rainbow.,
Phoenix,It all came to a head when the prosecution summoned a key eyewitness that could place Rainbow at the murder scene.,
Phoenix,"It seemed like an airtight, conclusive testimony at first, but the cross-examination revealed that it contained several contradictions.",
Phoenix,Contradictions that suggested the witness herself could be the true culprit of the murder.,
Phoenix,That witness…,
Phoenix,…was Fluttershy.,sfx-huhlow2.wav
Athena,"Wait, what?! F-Fluttershy?!",sfx-stab2.wav
Phoenix,Yep.,
Athena,"N-No, that can’t be true. There’s no way YOU would have done that. I-I mean, I know I only just met her, but she’s FLUTTERSHY! She’s too yellow and shy and—",
Twilight,"But it DID happen, Athena.",sfx-punch2.wav
Phoenix,"I was desperate. The judge was about to hand down the guilty verdict, and I needed a way to stop it from happening.",
Phoenix,"So, even though I was aware of the severity of the accusation… I indicted Fluttershy on the charge of murder.",
Athena,Boss... You didn't really think that...,
Phoenix,"That she was guilty? No, not in the slightest. But what I did made Twilight lose almost all of her faith in me.",
Phoenix,"Sure, I’d managed to prolong the trial for at least another day, but the cost was far higher than I could have expected.",
Athena,"Is… is that why you tried to stop me, Twilight?",
Twilight,"Yes. As you know, I was Phoenix’s co-counsel during that trial. I couldn’t believe he’d ever do such a thing.",
Twilight,"At the time, I thought he was really trying to accuse Fluttershy.",
Twilight,It wasn’t until later that I learned he was trying to find another way to save Rainbow.,
Twilight,I just wish it didn’t have to be THAT way…,
Phoenix,…,
Athena,"B-but that doesn’t matter, right? Because, in the end, you won!",
Phoenix,True… but what I did could have made us lose sight of something even more important than the trial’s outcome.,
Athena,Something even more important?,
Phoenix,The truth.,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,The… truth?,
Athena,(What does he mean by that? Isn’t… isn’t that the same thing as fighting for someone’s innocence?),
Phoenix,...,
Bailiff #1,"Excuse me sir, I’m going to have to ask you to please return to your seat in the gallery. The attorney and her counsel need time to prepare their case before the trial resumes.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Phoenix,"I’d better get going, then—wouldn’t want the bailiff to yell at me. Good luck, you two.",
Twilight,"Thank you, Phoenix!",
Athena,"I… Thanks, Boss.",
Twilight,Athena.,
Athena,"Y-yeah, Twilight?",
Twilight,"I know you regret accusing Zecora, and I am thankful that you apologized to her.",
Twilight,"However, what happened during the trial, it… just reopened some old wounds.",
Athena,"I’m really sorry, Twilight.",
Twilight,"Even so, I can’t dwell on what’s already past.",
Athena,!?,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Twilight,"I said last night that I would stand with you in court, and that’s exactly what I intend to do.",
Twilight,"If we want to save Turning Page and Scootaloo, we should focus on the rest of the trial. After that, we can work things out between us.",
Athena,Right.,
Twilight,"Besides, I think it’s about time we asked those two some questions.",
Athena,Huh?,
Athena,Oh! Scootaloo! Turning Page!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Scootaloo,H-hey…,
Turning,"Hello, Princess Twilight. Ms. Cykes.",
Athena,Are you guys okay?,
Scootaloo,"Yeah, we’re fine. It’s just… this whole trial thing is kind of exhausting.",
Athena,(No arguments here…),
Twilight,"If you think you’re up to it, we’d like to ask you more about the case. There are still a lot of blank spots to fill in, after all.",
Turning,Sure. I’ll do everything I can to help! Ask us anything!,
Twilight,"Well, first I’d like to ask YOU to clarify something for us, Turning Page.",
Turning,Yes?,
Twilight,"Apple Bloom mentioned yesterday that, after you all went for lunch on the day of the incident, your mother found you and hurried you away.",
Turning,"That’s… that’s right, yes.",
Twilight,Can you tell us why?,
Turning,"You’ve probably already figured it out, but… it was because of what I did. Like always, it seems…",
Athena,!?,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,(It… seems?),
Twilight,"It has something to do with Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, doesn’t it?",
Turning,"Diamond Tiara, to be specific.",
Turning,"When I attacked her earlier that day, her dress got dirty. She told her mom about what happened, and then they went to see my mom.",
Athena,(Right. This is all stuff we heard in the trial earlier.),
Turning,"After Mom heard about what happened, she went to go find me. She was really mad, and wanted me to apologize to Diamond Tiara and her mother.",
Turning,Hmph! I don’t see why I should have to. I...,
Turning,"I don’t regret what I did, not one bit!",sfx-punch2.wav
Turning,A true member of the Royal Guard should never have to apologize for doing the right thing!,
Scootaloo,"I’m sorry, Turning…",
Twilight,"What about the money, though? It wasn’t just an apology Spoiled Rich wanted.",
Turning,Y-yeah. I know. That whole discussion happened after Mom brought me back home.,
Turning,"Diamond and her mother came over so I could formally apologize, and that’s when Mrs. Rich demanded my mom pay her back for the dresses.",
Turning,"Before I could even try anything, Mom sent me away. She forced me to stay in my room the whole time they were talking. I overheard everything, though.",
Turning,"I couldn’t believe Mom agreed to pay back the bits. We don’t have that kind of money! If only she would’ve let me at that mare, I would’ve—",
Athena,"Sorry, did you say Mrs. Rich AND Diamond Tiara came over to your house?",sfx-huh.wav
Turning,"Yeah, why?",
Athena,"Could this…? Wait, no…",
Twilight,"No, go ahead, Athena. Have you thought of something?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,"Well, umm… I guess. You think maybe Diamond Tiara… could’ve planted the magazines at that point?",sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,"It DOES line up very nicely with our theory. I assume you didn’t see anything, Turning Page?",
Turning,Y-Yeah. I was in my room the whole time after apologizing.,
Turning,"I don’t know what happened in the house after that, aside from the conversation between my mom and Mrs. Rich.",
Twilight,"Well, without Turning Page’s testimony it’s unfortunately not conclusive. I doubt Fair Devotion saw anything, so at this point it’s still only a theory.",
Athena,"(That clears up that mystery for now, I hope. Now for another one… )",
Athena,"Turning, Scootaloo, can I ask you two something else?",
Scootaloo,"W-what is it, Ms. Cykes?",
Athena,What actually happened that night in the forest? When you arrived at the blackmail site?,
Scootaloo,"Um, sure. We can tell you about that. Right, Turning?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Turning,Yeah.,
Athena,So what happened?,
Scootaloo,"You kind of figured this out yesterday, but there WAS a fight there. Between Turning Page and me, and Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.",
Twilight,"Could you go over it for us? Any details you can remember will help, even if they’re small, or might not seem important.",
Scootaloo,Well…,
Scootaloo,"We got there at exactly 10:00, but it looked like we were the only ones to arrive.",
Scootaloo,Here we are. This is the meeting place.,
Turning,"Are you ready, Scootaloo?",
Scootaloo,Y-yeah. We just have to make sure we get what we came here for. Can you pass me the roll of golden silk?,
Turning,Are you sure? I can keep holding it with my magic—,
Scootaloo,"I know, but… Now that we’re here, I feel like it’s my responsibility.",
Turning,All right…,
Scootaloo,"Thanks, Turning. Now, where are they—Ah! Turning, get back! If they see your face, they’ll freak!",sfx-stab2.wav
Diamond,"Well, well, well! Looks like you DO have brains in those heads of yours, after all! Or two of you, at least!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Silver Spoon,Which one of you was too scared to come? Let me guess!,
Scootaloo,"Ha, ha. Knock it off, you two. It’s Scootaloo. I’m here by myself, with umm… an escort! Now give me our stuff back!",
Diamond,Scootaloo? Ha! How hilarious! YOU were the only one who didn’t chicken out?,sfx-punch2.wav
Silver Spoon,"You see, it’s funny because she-",
Turning,"Ms. Scootaloo told you to knock it off! Now hand over everything you stole, villains!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Diamond,Hm?! Wait… YOU! You brought HIM with you?!,sfx-punch2.wav
Silver Spoon,Huh. Why him?,sfx-huh.wav
Scootaloo,Does it matter? Let’s just get this over with.,
Diamond,"Tch! Do you have it, then?",
Scootaloo,"Yes. You can have your stupid golden silk, all right? Now give us our stuff back, like you promised!",
Diamond,...,
Diamond,I don’t know. It seems like you didn’t fully honor our deal.,
Scootaloo,What?! What are you talking about?!,sfx-damage.wav
Silver Spoon,DT?,
Diamond,"You read the letter, didn’t you? Then you would have known we expected all THREE of you to come, not just one of you!",
Diamond,"And not only that, you decided to bring somepony ELSE along! That wasn’t allowed, according to our demands! Isn’t that right, Silver Spoon?",
Silver Spoon,"Hm? Oh! Yes, exactly! Of course!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Scootaloo,"Actually, Diamond Tiara, your letter didn’t say anything about that.",
Diamond,Wh-?! You brought that WITH you?!,sfx-punch2.wav
Scootaloo,Uh-huh. I thought you might try to pull something like this. All your letter says is to come here without any adults.,
Scootaloo,"It doesn’t say it has to be all three of us, or that we can’t bring anypony else along.",
Diamond,Argh!,
Scootaloo,I brought you what you wanted! That should be–!,
Scootaloo,HEY!,sfx-damage.wav
Turning,Scootaloo!,sfx-punch2.wav
Diamond,I don’t think you understand how this works.,
Diamond,"I don’t CARE what the letter says! I’M the one in charge here, and you’ll do as I say!",
Diamond,"And as far as I’M concerned, you broke the rules.",
Scootaloo,Grrr…,sfx-punch2.wav
Diamond,"Tell you what, though. If you go on back and get us another roll, maybe we’ll think about giving you your stuff back! We’ll stay here, don’t you worry!",
Silver Spoon,"DT, we don’t really need two, though, do we? A-and it’s getting darker already…",
Turning,"Rgghh! First you blackmail the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and then you won’t even hold up your end of the deal! You…",
Turning,You have no sense of honor! You’ll pay for this!,sfx-furious.wav
Turning,Hiyaaah!,
Diamond,Aaagh!,sfx-stab2.wav
Turning,"I swung my sword at Diamond Tiara, and she fell onto Silver Spoon. She dropped the fabric, and knocked Silver’s glasses off at the same time.",
Scootaloo,"At that point, Turning Page told me to take the scooter, fabric, everything, and flee the scene with them. I quickly scrambled to gather everything up.",
Scootaloo,"But because I was in a hurry, I forgot to pick up the blackmail letter. I dropped it when Diamond Tiara grabbed the fabric from me.",
Scootaloo,"Once I had everything else, though, I was ready to leave. I… I wanted to stick around and make sure he would make it out alright, but he insisted he’d be fine. So, eventually, I did.",
Turning,"It was a good thing, too, because by then the two fillies had recovered. Diamond Tiara was furious, but because of that, she didn’t watch where she was going.",
Turning,"Right as she attempted to follow Scootaloo, she stomped on Silver’s glasses, breaking them.",
Turning,"But they were still coming. I could have hit them again, but had an even better idea. Using my magic, I grabbed Diamond Tiara’s little tiara and chucked it into the gorge.",
Turning,That did the job. Diamond Tiara screamed and dragged Silver Spoon down the stairs after it. And that was when I left.,
Scootaloo,And that’s it. That’s everything that we know about what happened at the castle that night.,
Athena,(I… I don’t even know where to begin with all that…),
Twilight,What I’d like to know is why you kept this from us.,
Twilight,"I know you didn’t have time yesterday, but what about this morning? This would have been helpful to know before the trial.",
Athena,"Or even earlier in court, in fact, when we tried to establish exactly when and how you two left the scene.",
Scootaloo,"T-there’s a reason for that, actually.",sfx-huh.wav
Athena,"What’s the reason, then?",
Scootaloo,"Well… it was because of Princess Luna. She told us to keep quiet about it. How we both left the scene, I mean.",
Athena,!?,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Twilight,What?!,
Athena,"Wait! So you mean… when you spoke with her earlier this morning, she told you not to mention that, even to us?!",
Turning,"Not exactly. She—ah! I mean, Princess Luna said we should tell you before the trial began, but we shouldn’t say anything in court.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Turning,"At least, not until something could prove the scooter had left the scene at one point. Otherwise, it would have looked like a lie, since the scooter was found AT the scene.",
Turning,"We did want to tell you about everything this morning, but, as soon as we got to this lobby… Well, you know what happened…",
Scootaloo,…,
Athena,(So Luna was trying to help us before the trial even started…),
Twilight,That was… rather smart of her. It’s almost eerie how she knew…,
Twilight,It makes me wonder what’ll happen when we step back inside the courtroom. If there’s anything else Luna has anticipated…,
Athena,"(I’m not sure how to feel, knowing that. If she knew from the very beginning what direction we needed to take, what else does she know?)",
Athena,"Out of curiosity, Scootaloo, how far did you get on your scooter? And how did it end up back at the crime scene?",
Scootaloo,Well… I can’t really say. I was so scared being in the forest that I couldn’t keep track of how far I got.,
Athena,"Well, then, how fast can you go on your scooter? Maybe we can estimate the distance based on that.",
Scootaloo,"Hmm… If I’m on my scooter, I’d say I can usually shave off about a third of how long it’d usually take on hoof. But that’s about as accurate I can get. Sorry.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,That's all right. When would you say you left the blackmail site itself?,
Scootaloo,"Umm, I don’t really know… Maybe… about five minutes after we got there?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,"(So… at around 10:05, then.)",
Athena,"(It normally takes 15 minutes to walk from the castle to Zecora’s hut, so it would’ve taken Scootaloo about ten.)",
Athena,"(She’d pass by at around 10:15, which means Zecora wouldn’t have seen her go by...)",
Twilight,"Turning Page, when did you leave the scene?",
Turning,About a minute after Ms. Scootaloo.,
Twilight,"And you went the same way she did, right?",
Turning,R-right…,
Twilight,Does that mean you were the shadowy figure that Zecora saw?,
Turning,Y-yes… that was me.,
Athena,"Did you see Scootaloo, or anything else out of the ordinary, while leaving? Maybe someone carrying the scooter back to the scene?",
Turning,"I’m… afraid not, Ms. Cykes…",
Athena,Really? Then… how did the scooter get back to the crime scene?,
Bailiff #2,"Defendants! Attorney! The trial is about to resume! Head back inside, on the double!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,Looks like we’ll have to figure that out later.,
Twilight,"Scootaloo, Turning Page. You two head on in first. Okay?",
Scootaloo,"O-okay, Twilight. Come on, Turning.",
Twilight,"Well, I guess we’d better go in, too. You ready, Athena?",
Athena,"About as ready as I can be, I suppose. Let’s go, Twilight.",
Private Eye,"Pardon me for interrupting, Princess Twilight, Ms. Cykes.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,Private Eye?,
Athena,(What’s he doing here?),
Private Eye,"Sir, might the defense have a moment longer before they enter the courtroom? It’s urgent.",
Bailiff #2,"… I don’t get paid extra to babysit tardy lawyers, y’know. But fine. A few minutes, maximum.",
Private Eye,"Splendid! Thank you, sir.",
Twilight,"What do you mean by “urgent,” Private Eye?",
Private Eye,I have some things here you would do well to look through.,
Private Eye,"First, are you aware of the clearing in the forest between the crossroads and Zecora’s hut?",
Athena,"I see it, yeah. Right here? What about it?",
Private Eye,"An investigation was recently performed there, and traces of a wiped bloodstain were found. You can see it right here in this photograph.",
Twilight,And… do you know who the blood belongs to?,
Private Eye,"I do. The blood has been identified as belonging to the victim, Royal Order.",
Athena,What?! Really?,sfx-punch2.wav
Private Eye,"The tests confirm it, Ms. Cykes. The blood is, without question, that of the victim’s.",
Twilight,I can’t believe it…,
Athena,"This changes so much! Thank you, Private Eye!",
Private Eye,"You needn’t thank me, Ms. Cykes. I am simply the messenger.",
Twilight,You mean…somepony else was responsible for this investigation?,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,"Indeed, Princess. A… mutual acquaintance of ours, you might say.",
Twilight,A mutual acquaintance?,sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,"So, did this… mutual acquaintance… find anything else?",
Private Eye,"Two things, as a matter of fact. This was found near the crossroads. Take a look.",
Twilight,T-This is—,sfx-damage.wav
Athena,The broken handlebar… from Scootaloo’s scooter!,
Twilight,You say this was found near the crossroads?,
Private Eye,"That is correct. Specifically, it was found concealed within the underbrush. It seems my team missed it during our investigation of the woods.",
Athena,"If the handlebar was found at the crossroads, then I guess that answers the question of how far Scootaloo made it on her scooter.",
Twilight,And it broke off somehow after she got there…?,
Athena,(But… how would it have broken?),
Twilight,"What’s the second thing you have for us, Private Eye?",
Private Eye,"This, Princess.",
Athena,Uh… A piece of wood? What’s so special about that?,
Twilight,Ah! Is that what I think it is?!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,"Indeed, Princess. It’s a timberwolf fang.",
Athena,A what?!,sfx-huh.wav
Private Eye,This was found in front of the Nightmare Night statue.,
Private Eye,"We didn’t think anything of it at first, but our mutual acquaintance realized it possessed the same enchantment found in timberwolves.",
Private Eye,"As to why it was at the statue, or if it’s related to the current incident, I can’t say for certain.",
Twilight,...,
Athena,(Wow! What a haul! I sure hope I can meet this pony so that I can thank them for all of this! Now we just have to make it count!),
Athena,"Thank you for delivering all of this to us, Private Eye. We appreciate it.",
Private Eye,"You are very welcome, Ms. Cykes. I wish you both the best.",
Twilight,"Oh, before you go, Private Eye. Can you do something for me?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,"Certainly, Your Highness.",
Twilight,"Could you contact this “mutual acquaintance” for us? I’m not sure if it’ll lead to anything, but I’d like for the crossroads to be tested, forensically.",
Private Eye,"I’ll get to work immediately, Princess.",
Twilight,"Thank you, Private Eye.",
Bailiff #2,"Are you about done over there? Tick tock, you two!",sfx-punch2.wav
Athena,"Y-yes! Sorry, we’ll be right there! Come on, Twilight, we’d better hurry.",
Twilight,Right!,
Rainbow,WHAT?! You guys seriously believe her?! There’s no way she’d help us!,sfx-punch2.wav
Sonata,*clears throat*,
Sonata,"I AM right here, you know.",
Rainbow,Unfortunately…,
Twilight,"Rainbow! Come on, can’t you see she’s trying to atone for what she did?",sfx-damage.wav
Spike,"Let’s just… calm down, okay? No need to start getting nasty, right?",
Sonata,"I’m not here for an argument, Ms. Dash. I want to help. As much as I wish I could, I can’t undo what I’ve done.",
Sonata,All I can do is simply repent for my actions by helping those in need of it.,
Sonata,"I understand if you can’t forgive me. But please, at least believe me when I say that I’m not the same mare I once was.",
Rainbow,Grgh!,
Rainbow,"I don’t have to believe a word you say, and I NEVER will! C’mon, squirt! Let’s go!",sfx-punch2.wav
Scootaloo,B-but…,
Rainbow,"Don’t tell me you’re buying this, too?",sfx-huh.wav
Rainbow,"She’s a liar, kid!",
Rainbow,And a criminal! She’s the one who set me up last time!,
Scootaloo,I…,
Scootaloo,"....I know what happened, yeah.",
Scootaloo,"But I believe her! She offered to defend me! And now she’s helping us fight for Sweetie Belle, too!",
Scootaloo,"So, please! Trust her! Please, Rainbow Dash?",
Rainbow,...,
Twilight,Rainbow?,
Rainbow,"The rest of you might have fallen for her lies, but I won’t!",
Rainbow,So I’ll catch you guys later…,
Rainbow,.....when you’ve ditched HER!,
Scoots & AB,…,
Apollo & TS,...,
Spike,That couldn’t have gone any worse…,
Athena,"(So much anger… and…a twinge of sadness. Because nobody shares the same feelings as her, I wonder?)",
Sonata,It may have been better had I simply not accompanied you all here…,
Apollo,"No. It’s not your fault, Sonata. She just needs time. To forgive, I mean.",
Fluttershy,Umm… is everypony okay?,
Spike,"Hey, Fluttershy! Y-yeah, we’re alright, thanks.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Fluttershy,"It’s just, well, we saw Rainbow Dash flying away, and she was very mad.",
Pinkie Pie,She looked like she was going to explode. And not in a happy “I’m so excited!” way.,
Applejack,"Yeah, we know, gals.",
Twilight,"Where have you two been, by the way? You disappeared right after the trial, Fluttershy.",
Twilight,"And Pinkie, we haven’t seen you since yesterday. And you both look exhausted. Which is saying a lot for you, Pinkie.",
Pinkie Pie,O-oh! Y-you think? Hehe…,sfx-huh.wav
Applejack,"Oh, you know how it is, Twi! Everypony’s busy these days!",sfx-huhhigher.wav
Twilight,"That doesn’t answer my question, though.",
Applejack,"Anyway, how about a glass of juice for ‘em? They look parched!",sfx-stab2.wav
Rarity,"Yes. I could do with a drink myself, darling! If it’s not too much trouble, of course?",
Twilight,"Erm… no, it’s… fine. Just give me a minute.",
Twilight,Athena?,
Athena,"Yeah, Twilight?",
Twilight,Why don’t we fill everypony in on where we’re at with the investigation?,
Athena,Right!,
Athena,"(Better than lingering on what just happened, I guess…)",
Athena,"So, we know a lot more about the victim, as well as several other relevant ponies involved in this case.",
Athena,"Royal Order, Fair Devotion, Sugar Stamp. I think I finally have a handle on all of them now.",
Scootaloo,That’s great!,
Apple Bloom,Just what I’d expect from a lawyer who can save two ponies at once!,
Athena,But… I don’t know what to think of Sweetie Belle.,"sfx-lightbulb.wav,sfx-huh.wav"
Scoots & AB,Huh?!,sfx-hit1.wav
Rarity,"W-what do you mean, Ms. Cykes?",
Athena,"I just… don’t know what to do. I’m not convinced that I can even trust her, after everything that’s happened.",
Apple Bloom,"But why not?! Yeah, she’s been fibbing a bit, but that don’t mean you can’t trust her about this!",sfx-stab2.wav
Scootaloo,…,
Athena,"I’m sorry, Apple Bloom. But if I’m going to win in tomorrow’s trial, I need to be able to completely trust in my client.",
Athena,"So, don’t worry. I’m still going to defend Sweetie Belle. It’s just going to be a little bit harder, is all.",
Rarity,"I can’t thank you enough, Ms. Cykes. For agreeing to this, despite the circumstances.",
Athena,"You’re welcome, Rarity.",
Phoenix,Athena?,sfx-huhlow2.wav
Athena,"Yeah, boss?",
Phoenix,Can I have a word with you?,
Athena,"Um, sure. What’s up?",
Athena,(It’s never a good sign when your boss wants to “talk.”),
Phoenix,"Okay. It’s about today’s trial, and this case. I can see that you’re trying to prove yourself in some way.",
Athena,…Yeah. I guess I am.,
Phoenix,This whole “doing everything by yourself” attitude. I want you to drop it. Now.,
Athena,Huh?,
Phoenix,"You haven’t really been hiding it, Athena. You took on a case with two defendants at the same time and wanted to do it completely alone.",
Phoenix,"And while I was content to support you, today has made me realise that your mind is in the wrong place.",
Athena,W-what do you mean?,
Phoenix,"Like I said, wanting to do everything by yourself. It’s causing more harm than good, and will continue to do so if you keep forcing yourself like this.",
Athena,You mean like when I thought I had to accuse Zecora… don’t you?,
Twilight,…,
Phoenix,… Yeah.,
Athena,"But… How am I supposed to get any better? Both you and Apollo are amazing defense attorneys! And then there’s me, limping behind.",
Apple Bloom,Athena…,
Athena,I just want to be a good attorney.... one I can be proud of.,
Athena,One YOU can be proud of.,
Athena,"One that can take on cases without having to rely on everyone’s help, like you.",
Phoenix,"Athena, I don’t know what sort of image you have of me in your head, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.",
Athena,Huh?,sfx-huh.wav
Phoenix,"Sure, I may be able to stand at the bench by myself from time to time.",
Phoenix,But that doesn’t mean I don’t ever need help.,
Phoenix,"No matter the trial, there’s always an ally to be found somewhere.",
Phoenix,"It might be a friend by my side, a prosecutor who wants to make the truth known, a witness willing to give an honest testimony, or a fair judge.",
Phoenix,"So you see? I’m rarely, if ever, alone in the courtroom.",
Athena,"I… I dunno, Mr. Wright. It’s easy for you to say that, but I feel like if I don’t at least try things by myself sometimes, I won’t get anywhere.",
Phoenix,…,
Phoenix,"Let me tell you something, Athena. About the one trial where I was truly alone, and how it turned out.",
Apollo,Wait! You don’t mean..!,
Trucy,…,
Phoenix,I do. I’m talking about the trial that got me disbarred.,
Athena,!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Sonata,You were… disbarred?,
Phoenix,I was.,
Twilight,"I know you mentioned that you were disbarred, but you never actually gave the reason for it. I didn’t want to pry.",
Phoenix,"Thank you, Twilight. It’s… not a very pleasant memory.",
Athena,What happened?,
Phoenix,I was there by myself. No co-counsel.,
Phoenix,"The prosecutor was a complete stranger, and one that didn’t trust me, either.",
Phoenix,The star witness cared more about their own affairs than giving a decent testimony.,
Phoenix,"Of course, I didn’t think much of it.",
Phoenix,"I was arrogant, and I thought I could handle all of it.",
Phoenix,"And in the end, I paid the price.",
Sonata,What was it that caused you to get disbarred?,
Phoenix,I presented forged evidence.,
,WHAT?!,sfx-shocked.wav
Twilight,N-no! That’s… That had to have been a mistake!,
Apollo,It was. Mr. Wright didn’t know about it at all. He thought it was a legitimate piece of evidence.,
Phoenix,Except I had no proof I didn’t know. So they stripped me of my badge regardless.,
Athena,"I had no idea about any of that. I mean, I knew you were disbarred. We met when you weren’t a lawyer, after all. But I can’t believe it…",
Phoenix,"And then, there was the time I met Apollo.",
Apollo,W-what? Me?,
Phoenix,"When you defended me, remember? And… what I had to do in order to trap the one responsible for me losing my badge.",
Apollo,Ngh… Mr. Wright. Do we need to bring that up?,
Athena,What are you talking about? Bring what up?,
Phoenix,"When he was my attorney, I gave Apollo evidence to use in his first trial, to force the killer to admit to the crime.",
Phoenix,"Only this time, it was evidence I really did… forge.",
Everyone,…,
Rarity,"Is that true, Mr. Wright?",
Phoenix,Yes. Sadly.,
Sonata,…,
Phoenix,"Do you see my point, Athena?",
Phoenix,"How one mistake, made while trying to go it alone, can lead you down a path you’d never imagined yourself going down?",
Phoenix,One you still regret to this day?,
Phoenix,"Because the truth is, I’m worried.",
Phoenix,That you’ll make a similar mistake and ruin your life like I nearly did.,
Athena,"I… I understand. Thank you, Boss. I’m… I’m sorry to have been so boneheaded.",
Phoenix,"It’s okay, Athena.",
Athena,"I mean it, though. I can tell that you’re being serious.",
Phoenix,Heh.,
Phoenix,"I’m a real whirlwind of emotions right now, I’m guessing?",
Athena,"Yeah. I’ve never seen, or heard, you like this before.",
Athena,So I promise that I’ll take what you said to heart.,
Athena,(For Mr. Wright to reveal something like that… I can’t go against what I’ve just said.),
Athena,(So that’s it. No more self-pity. No more stubbornness. No. More.),
Athena,(So that’s it. No more self-pity. No more stubbornness. No. More.),
Phoenix,"Sorry for making things a little awkward, everyone.",
Applejack,"Ain’t nothing you gotta apologize for, Phoenix. Talking about something like that takes courage. That’s mighty admirable.",
Sonata,It’s getting quite late. I think I’d better be off for now.,
Twilight,"Oh, no. Don’t worry, Sonata. You can stay here.",
Sonata,It’s fine. I have a room at the Hay and Stay hotel.,
Pinkie Pie,"Wow, you’re a regular… err… regular at that place, aren’t you?",
Sonata,"When I’m not in prison, at least. I do enjoy it there, admittedly.",
Applejack,"I reckon we’re gonna head off, too. If these two gals are gonna be at the trial tomorrow, they’ll need some shut-eye. Ready, you two?",
Apple Bloom,"Sure thing, sis.",
Scootaloo,Uh-huh.,
AB & Scoots,See you all tomorrow!,
Athena,"Good night, you two. Sleep well!",
Fluttershy,"I’d like to stay for a little longer, if that’s okay?",
Twilight,"No worries, Fluttershy. What about you, Pinkie? No party, I’m afraid. We’re a bit too tired for it.",
Pinkie Pie,That’s A-okay! We can have fun in other ways! Just tell me how the trial went!,
Trucy,"I hope you’re ready for a long story, Pinkie!",
Pinkie Pie,Yay! It can be my past-my-bedtime story!,
Athena,"Ehh… maybe tell her about something else, Trucy?",
Pinkie Pie,Huh?,sfx-huh.wav
Athena,"Today wasn’t my finest hour, Pinkie. I… made a pretty wild accusation towards someone, and blamed them for something they clearly didn’t do.",
Pinkie Pie,"Oh… well, I know what that’s like. It’s no fun when that happens…",
Pinkie Pie,"But, hey! You know better now, right? And you’re sorry about it. So nopony’s gonna hold it against you! Trust me!",
Pinkie Pie,…,
Athena,"You’re right. Thanks, Pinkie.",
Rarity,"I’ll be heading back to Carousel Boutique, darlings. I’ve tried to clean it up as best as I can after today’s incident, but I won’t be satisfied until it’s spotless.",
Spike,"Just relax for now, Rarity. You’ve had a rough day.",
Sonata,"I’ll accompany you, Ms. Rarity. My hotel is on the way.",
Rarity,"You’re ever so kind, Sonata. Thank you.",
Rarity,"Good night, everypony. I’ll speak to you tomorrow at the trial.",
Athena,"(I should probably get some sleep, too. Two trials back-to-back is pretty rough… and tomorrow probably won’t be any easier.)",
Athena,Wh… Where am I? Is this… Twilight’s castle?,
Athena,Hello? Is anypony there?,
Athena,(That’s strange… where is everyone? I could have sworn we all went to bed together…),
Athena,"Oh, Twilight! Thank goodness. Do you know where everyone went?",
Twilight,How could you…,
Athena,Huh? Twilight?,
Twilight,How could you not listen to me? I thought we were friends! Don’t you trust me?,
Athena,"Twilight, what are you talking about?! Of course I do!",
Apple Bloom,"You accused Zecora! You were trying to make ponies hate her! Because you hate her, too!",
Athena,"What?! Apple Bloom, no! That’s not true!",sfx-stab.wav
Apollo,To think that you would do something so stupid…,
Trucy,No magic trick or sleight-of-hand will save you from this mistake…,
Athena,"Apollo, Trucy! W-wait! Let me explain, I-I was just—",
Phoenix,"To think I once believed you’d take us into a new age of law… I regret ever having met you, ever having given you a chance. You’re nothing but a screw up!",sfx-huhlow.wav
Athena,NO! BOSS! PLEASE!,
,"Screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up, screw up….",
Athena,NO! I’M NOT! STOP IT! GET AWAY FROM ME! GET OUT OF MY HEAD! GET OUT OF MY HEAD! GET OUT OF MY HEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAADDDDD!,"sfx-damage.wav,sfx-shocked.wav,sfx-stab.wav,sfx-punch2.wav"
Athena,P…. Princess Luna?! What are you doing here in Twilight’s Castle? Shouldn’t you be back in Canterlot?,
Luna,"I should, but I am not—and neither are you in Twilight’s Castle.",
Athena,Huh?!,"sfx-huh.wav,"
Luna,"Consider, Athena, what you just saw. The others have randomly disappeared, save for a select few of your friends, who began, without warning, to harass and taunt you.",
Athena,Y-yeah. That… was a little strange.,
Luna,"It was more than a little strange. It was completely out-of-character for them, wouldn’t you say?",
Athena,"I… I… Y-yeah, wait. You’re right! B-boss has never been that mean before! But… why was he—",
Luna,"There’s an easy explanation for this, Athena. What you saw, what you heard, wasn’t real. It was all in your mind. You were having a nightmare.",
Athena,"A… nightmare? You mean, I’m dreaming?",sfx-huh.wav
Luna,That is correct.,
Athena,"B-but, wait, then what are you doing here? Uh... Are you part of my dream, too?",
Athena,(Sheesh! Dreaming about the prosecutor? That can’t be a good sign!),
Luna,"No, Athena. You did not dream me into existence. I am, in fact, as real as you are.",
Athena,"Then… how are you here, exactly?",
Luna,"I am the Princess of the Night. Among the other powers afforded to me, it's my duty to watch over everypony’s dreams.",
Athena,Wait… you LITERALLY go into people’s dreams?!,sfx-stab.wav
Luna,"On a nightly basis, yes. From this dreamscape I can enter the subconscious of anyone.",
Luna,"Most of the time, it is to dispel the nightmares that sometimes plague this realm. Nightmares like the one you had, in fact.",
Athena,"Then, what you said in court. When you said you deal with psychological issues every night… THIS is what you meant?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Luna,"Indeed it is. All ponies dream, and all have their share of nightmarish scenarios and make-believe manifestations of their inner doubts and anxieties.",
Luna,It is my duty to combat them so that the dreamers may dream in peace.,
Athena,(That’s incredible… Luna must be extremely powerful to be able to banish any and all nightmares.),
Athena,"Hang on. You say you can enter anyone’s dreams. I’ve been here in Equestria for a few days. So, why haven’t I seen you until now?",
Luna,"I try my best to only intercede when the nightmares are of an incredibly tumultuous sort, Athena.",
Luna,It would be an immense invasion of privacy were I to step willy-nilly into somepony’s subconscious whenever I felt like it.,
Luna,"Though, that does not mean I am limited in what I can do and see while in the dreamscape.",
Luna,"In fact, it is here that I was able to determine I would be facing you and Twilight in the trial.",
Athena,"So we couldn’t even keep THAT from you, could we…?",sfx-huhlow.wav
Luna,"Hmm? I detect a note of bitterness in your voice, Athena. Is something the matter?",
Athena,"U-uh, n-no, of course not, Princess Luna! I was just—well…",
Athena,"Actually, yeah… there IS something that’s been bothering me.",
Luna,"Perhaps talking about it may help. That is the… psychological thing to do, yes?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,"Y-yeah, but it’s… it’s a bit awkward.",
Luna,And why’s that?,
Athena,"W-well, it… it’s about you, Princess Luna.",
Athena,"Not only did you know about Twilight and me being the defense, but you also actively kept us out of the loop when it came to your motives during the trial.",
Athena,"More than that, you told Scootaloo and Turning Page to not tell us ANYTHING.",
Athena,It wasn’t until halfway through the trial that I realized that everything you were doing was in order to help them.,
Athena,"You kept dropping hints, trying to guide me to a specific argument, while still keeping me on a leash, and rebutting every argument I made.",
Athena,You DEFINITELY knew more than you let on.,
Athena,(And what Equity said…),
Athena,"I guess I just don’t understand what you were doing. I can tell you’re trying to help us, but how does keeping us in the dark accomplish that?",
Athena,Were… Were we working towards the same goal? Were we both trying to save Scootaloo and Turning Page?,
Luna,"I had a feeling this conversation would happen, sooner or later. And before you ask, no, it is not because I saw it in your dreams.",
Athena,(I actually wasn’t thinking that.),
Luna,"I understand you’re frustrated with me. My answer… Is a bit complicated, but I shall attempt to explain.",
Luna,My reason for withholding information from you and Twilight Sparkle had nothing to do with being the prosecutor. It had to do with me being unsure of both of you.,
Athena,Unsure of both of us?,sfx-huh.wav
Luna,"I am familiar enough with Twilight Sparkle to know she means well, but you, I must confess, are a complete stranger.",
Luna,"I knew of your connection to Phoenix Wright, but as to your heart, I was unsure.",
Luna,"I… regrettably did not know if I could TRUST both of you, not only to work together, but to work WITH me as well.",
Luna,"As such, I thought it pertinent to keep you at hoof’s length.",
Luna,"Even so, I also knew I had to rely on the two of you to free both Scootaloo and Turning Page.",
Luna,"Thus, I attempted to act in such a way as to guide you to proving their innocence, without giving away that I was trying to do so.",
Athena,You mean… you knew they were innocent?,
Luna,"From the very beginning. And I believed, if you followed my guidance, that would inevitably be proven.",
Athena,But… why all the secrecy? Why not just tell the judge that you knew they were innocent? Why keep being the prosecutor?,
Luna,It is one of those situations where my hooves were tied before I had begun to unravel the mystery itself.,
Luna,"You will recall, no doubt, what I said during the beginning of the trial, about the original prosecutor being allocated elsewhere?",
Athena,Yes…,
Luna,"Before they were, they’d managed to build such a case against Turning and Scootaloo that I could not merely drop the charges held against them.",
Luna,"It may have been deemed suspicious, or represent a conflict of interest.",
Luna,"The judge might have thought I held an unfair bias towards the defendants, and would have chosen to appoint another prosecutor, one who did not harbor my sympathies.",
Athena,In which case… Turning and Scootaloo might have been found guilty in the end.,
Luna,"Quite right. My only available course of action was to take on the case as the lead prosecutor, and hope that,",
Luna,"despite the odds being stacked against you, you could find the truth.",
Luna,"Even if I wasn’t sure I could trust you, I wanted to believe that you could do that. I am glad to discover my anxieties were greatly misplaced.",
Luna,"Still—I cannot take back what I have done. My decision NOT to trust you was my own, and it could very well have hurt your case.",
Luna,"And… it is with significant guilt that I say, were I facing Phoenix Wright in court instead… I doubt I would have treated him as I treated you.",
Luna,"For that… I am truly sorry, Athena.",
Athena,I…,
Athena,(Being forced to continue the prosecution’s case despite not initially wanting to…),
Athena,"(And regretting having to do what you thought was necessary when, in the end, it ended up hurting people…)",
Athena,(I can DEFINITELY relate to that. Huh. Who would have thought I’d relate to TWO princesses?),
Athena,Princess Luna…,
Luna,"Yes, Athena?",
Athena,"Something I’ve been told all throughout this case, and especially after today’s trial, is that we have to move on from our mistakes at some point or another.",
Athena,We… can’t be bogged down by what we’ve done.,
Athena,"We can only learn, and hope to do better, or try to do better. And we can only hope we don’t make the same mistake twice.",
Athena,"I understand what you did and why you did it. I wish you didn’t, but I get it.",
Athena,"And… I’m willing to set that aside, if it means, together, we can find the truth about what happened to Royal Order.",
Luna,"I believe Phoenix Wright would be proud to hear you say that, Athena.",
Luna,"And I would very much like to work with you, too, in order to discover the truth. Though I understand if you still have reservations about trusting me.",
Athena,"Actually, there may be a way to address those reservations.",
Luna,Really?,
Athena,"I don’t really know if you can give me any answers about this, but… recently, we learned something interesting about Royal Order.",
Athena,"During the trial, both you and Private Eye said that, while he was an excellent member of the Royal Guard,",
Athena,there was nothing all that significant about his position or status.,
Athena,there was nothing all that significant about his position or status.,
Athena,"But that wasn’t the whole truth, was it?",
Luna,…,
Athena,"We found out that he was meant to be the next Captain of the Royal Guard. That seems highly indicative of not only his abilities, but his reputation in the ranks.",
Athena,"But you and Private Eye saw fit to hide that information from not just us, but the general public, as well. Why?",
Luna,"I’m afraid I cannot disclose that information. It is not out of mistrust for you, however. It is… of a nature far more sensitive than I am at liberty to say.",
Athena,I… see.,
Athena,"(To be honest, I suspected that. This seems like too huge of a detail to just sweep under the rug over a matter of trust. But what could be her reason?)",
Luna,"However, if you are really interested in knowing, then I suggest you and the rest of your team stay in Equestria once this case is over.",
Athena,"(Stay? Even longer? Not that I would mind, but Apollo… and the agency…)",sfx-huhlow.wav
Luna,"That being said, how did you know he was supposed to be the next captain?",
Athena,"Oh, um. Somepony told us about it. The Lawkeeper.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Luna,Lawkeeper Equity.,
Athena,"Y-yeah. I guess you’d know of her, since she’s part of the High Council.",
Luna,"We’ve… met, a few times. Was there anything else she told you?",
Athena,"Well… She talked about her lack of trust in others, and how trust is naive. And that made me think about what’s going on now, with regards to Sweetie Belle.",
Athena,"I’m not sure… I’m not sure if I can fully trust her. All throughout this case, Sweetie’s been hiding something. And even though she accepted my help…",
Athena,"It’s like, she isn’t sure she WANTS the truth to be known. And if that’s the case, then how can I put my trust in her, if she won’t put her trust in me?",
Athena,I think what Lawkeeper Equity said is really getting to me…,
Luna,To have a belief that extreme… To think trusting others is a mark of naivete… It must have come out of some profound personal injury or sense of injustice.,
Luna,"I suppose I can sympathize. I myself was once overcome by a bitterness so encompassing, it transformed me…",
Athena,(Nightmare Moon…),
Luna,"But, still, I believe you must, if nothing else, trust that, in the end, the truth WILL be found. Never mind what the Lawkeeper has said.",
Athena,"I know, but… it’s hard, sometimes. Like stumbling around in the dark hoping you’ll find a light switch. Except you don’t know if the room you’re in even has one.",
Luna,"Trust is a leap of faith, Athena. That’s all it ever is.",
Luna,"Nevertheless, I can say with certainty that Sweetie Belle is NOT the culprit.",
Athena,"That’s what I want to believe, too. But then who else could it be?",
Luna,"It is likely the other ponies involved: either Fair Devotion or Sugar Stamp. Or, perhaps, even both.",
Athena,(Yeah. It makes sense. Both would have more reason to kill Royal Order than Sweetie Belle.),
Athena,"(And yet… something about that seems off, to me. I feel like I’m missing some vital clue.)",
Luna,"Unfortunately, Athena, I believe it is time that I depart. The dreamscape is vast, and I must continue my duties in protecting it.",
Athena,"Ah, right. I won’t keep you any longer. Thank you, Princess Luna.",
Luna,"No, Athena. Thank you… for showing me I can trust you to find the truth, in any way you can.",
Athena,"Find the truth, huh? In any way I can…",
Athena,That’s odd. Why was the door left unlocked? Do you think Ms. Devotion forgot about it?,
Twilight,I’m not sure. Maybe Rainbow Dash forgot to lock it after she arrived. Though I don’t see her around.,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Fair Devotion,"Oh, Princess Twilight. Ms. Cykes. I suppose I should have expected you. Though, not all of you…",
Athena,"(She seems… out of it. Not quite tired. Melancholy? I guess with everything that’s happened, I would be, too.)",
Twilight,"Good afternoon, Ms. Devotion. Sorry to barge in unannounced like this.",
Fair Devotion,"It’s all right, Princess Twilight. But what are you doing here? The trial’s over.",
Athena,"It is, yes, but we wanted to stop by and check up on Scootaloo and Turning Page. You know, see how they’re doing.",
Fair Devotion,"I see. That’s rather considerate of you, Ms. Cykes.",
Athena,So… may we see them?,
Fair Devotion,I suppose so. Follow me. They’re right over here.,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Rainbow,"Oh, hey, you guys made it! How was, er, the detention center?",
Athena,"Not a great deal of help, really. Sweetie Belle’s being questioned, and probably will be for a little while.",
Rainbow,"That blows. And, uh… what about Rarity?",
Phoenix,"She decided to stay there, along with Apollo, for when Sweetie Belle is released.",
Rainbow,"Right, right…",
Trucy,"How are you doing, Scootaloo?",
Scootaloo,I—,
Rainbow,"Scoots is doing just fine! Isn’t that right, squirt?",sfx-punch2.wav
Scootaloo,…,
Athena,"Let Scootaloo speak, Rainbow.",
Rainbow,"Uh, right, yeah. Heh, sorry.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Scootaloo,"I’m… okay, I guess. I’m just really tired.",
Trucy,Tired?,sfx-huh.wav
Scootaloo,"Yeah. I mean, before I was super excited and happy, but now that the trial’s over, it all just kinda hit me at once. How intense it was, I mean.",
Rainbow,"All you need is a little rest, that’s all! Then you’ll be up and at ‘em in no time!",
Scootaloo,I just hope Turning’s okay...,
Turning,Ms. Cykes! Princess Twilight! Everypony! What are you doing here?,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Twilight,"Hi, Turning Page. We wanted to check up on you and Scootaloo. How are you holding up?",
Turning,"I… I guess I’m okay. I’m relieved the trial’s over, that’s for sure.",
Fair Devotion,As am I. And I suppose I have you three to thank.,
Athena,Huh? Us three? But it was only Twilight and me.,sfx-huh.wav
Fair Devotion,"Yes, and I am grateful for your efforts in defending Turning Page and Scootaloo. But I must also thank Princess Luna.",
Athena,W-why would you thank her? She tried to pin the blackmailing on YOU! Aren’t you the least bit mad about that?,"sfx-huhhigh.wav,sfx-punch2.wav"
Fair Devotion,On the contrary. I was well aware that Princess Luna planned to accuse me from the very beginning.,
Athena,W-What? You were?!,sfx-huhhigher.wav
Fair Devotion,Yes. Princess Luna actually proposed the idea to me before the trial began.,
Twilight,And you went along with it? Knowing that you could have been charged for a crime you didn’t even commit?!,sfx-huhhighest.wav
Fair Devotion,"Of course, Princess Twilight. How could I refuse? The lives of my son and his friend were on the line.",
Fair Devotion,I would have done anything to prove their innocence. Anything.,
Fair Devotion,"Besides, it worked out in the end, as I hoped it would. Thanks to Princess Luna accusing me, you two were able to expose the truth, and get Turning and Scootaloo’s acquittal.",
Athena,"(Talk about self-sacrifice… maybe this is where Turning gets that from, now that I think about it.)",
Phoenix,Hang on a second. Does that mean Luna was aware that the magazines might have been planted in your house?,
Fair Devotion,"The possibility had crossed her mind, yes, but she had no way of proving it.",
Fair Devotion,"She decided, instead, to work with how the evidence was discovered, and hoped that the defense would be able to provide an alternative theory.",
Phoenix,Which led to us learning that Diamond Tiara had planted the magazines here.,
Fair Devotion,Exactly.,
Athena,All this intricacy… it’s almost as if Luna knows everything about the case. It makes me wonder why she even bothered prosecuting Turning and Scootaloo in the first place.,
Twilight,"Well… not everything, remember? She didn’t know about the clone until we were able to prove it existed. And she didn’t know who the blood behind the statue belonged to either.",
Phoenix,"Not until Sonata and Private Eye revealed it to her after the trial, in any case.",
Athena,"But even so, if she was so dead-set on proving Scootaloo and Turning Page innocent, why didn’t she at least let us in on the plan?",
Athena,"She told Ms. Devotion, she told Scootaloo and Turning… Heck, Zecora and Private Eye may have been in on it as well.","sfx-huh.wav,sfx-huhhigh.wav,sfx-huhhigher.wav"
Athena,Everyone seemed to know what was going to happen during the trial EXCEPT for us. Doesn’t that seem a bit… counterproductive?,sfx-huhhighest.wav
Twilight,"You… do have a point. She even went to great lengths to ensure that we didn’t know she was the prosecutor. Her actions do seem rather contradictory, in that regard.",
Athena,(Princess Luna… What drove you to be so secretive towards us? We’re all on the same side here… aren’t we?),
Fair Devotion,That reminds me… has Princess Luna expressed any knowledge about whoever sent that anonymous tip?,
Athena,"Not that I know of. And we don’t have a clear idea of who might have sent it, either.",
Fair Devotion,That… is unfortunate.,
Athena,Why do you ask?,
Fair Devotion,"O-Oh, uh, no reason, really. Just…",sfx-damage.wav
Fair Devotion,"If it hadn’t been for that tip, Turning Page wouldn’t have been involved, and Princess Luna wouldn’t have had to resort to accusing me.",
Twilight,We DO plan on asking Private Eye later to see if he knows anything about it.,
Fair Devotion,Then I do hope you are able to discover its sender.,
Scootaloo,Um. Athena? Twilight?,
Twilight,"Yes, Scootaloo?",
Scootaloo,I’m… really worried about Sweetie Belle. You said that you weren’t able to talk to her at the detention center?,
Twilight,"No, we weren’t. But, as we said, Rarity’s there, along with Apollo. So she won’t be alone. Don’t worry.",
Scootaloo,"W-well, if you are able to talk to her later… are you going to ask if she’d let you defend her?",
Athena,"Rarity already gave us permission, but we do plan on offering Sweetie Belle directly, yes.",
Scootaloo,That’s… good to hear.,
Twilight,"Hmm? What’s wrong, Scootaloo?",sfx-huh.wav
Scootaloo,"I… I don’t know. It’s just… this case, Royal Order, Sweetie Belle, everything… I’m just scared, I think. I don’t know what’s going to happen next.",
Scootaloo,"And what I did to Royal Order—well, one of them, anyway—how I accidentally stabbed him with my scooter…",
Scootaloo,"A-and how, Sweetie Belle, she—she might have done something similar. Something that she doesn’t even fully remember…",
Athena,"Having to recall something unpleasant you did is, admittedly, never a great feeling. But it’s through these recollections that the truth is eventually uncovered, Scootaloo.",
Athena,"Just like with you, today. And no matter what might have happened, it’s better to be aware of it, than live in ignorance.",
Athena,"I can’t say for certain what Sweetie Belle did or didn’t do at the statue that night, but whatever it was, we’ll find out. I’m sure it’ll show us that she didn’t kill anyone.",
Rainbow,"That’s right. Chin up, kid. I’m sure Sweetie Belle will be just fine! Athena and Twilight will clear her name, just like they did with you and Turning Page!",
Twilight,Really? That’s not what you said earlier at the castle.,
Rainbow,"U-um, well, y-you know, it’s just, what Apple Bloom said…",sfx-damage.wav
Scootaloo,Rainbow Dash? What’s… what’s Twilight talking about? What did you say earlier?,
Rainbow,"It’s… well, look. Sweetie Belle wasn’t exactly being all that helpful when YOU were arrested, remember? I’m still a little miffed about that.",sfx-punch2.wav
Athena,"(You can’t sweep that all under the rug, Rainbow. Sometime soon, you’ll have to come clean about what you’re really feeling. Not just for Scootaloo’s sake, but yours, as well.)",
Scootaloo,"Oh. I understand. I… I guess I’m still bothered by that, too. But it doesn’t make me any less worried, though.",
Athena,"We’ll do our best, Scootaloo. You have my word.",
Scootaloo,"Thank you, Athena.",
Fair Devotion,So what Turning said is true.,
Athena,"Hmm? What do you mean, Ms. Devotion?",sfx-huh.wav
Fair Devotion,"When I came to pick him and Scootaloo up, he told me that Sweetie Belle was arrested.",
Scootaloo,Yeah. It was proven that she was in the forest that night. B-but… she wasn’t involved with Royal Order’s death! It’s just… a coincidence… or something.,
Fair Devotion,"… Could that be it, I wonder?",
Athena,???,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,(What did she just say?),
Twilight,"Ms. Devotion, I know this is a difficult time for you, but would it be at all possible for us to ask you a few questions about your husband?",
Twilight,It might help us clear Sweetie Belle’s name.,
Fair Devotion,I suppose so. What would you like to know?,
Twilight,"We learned during the trial that, for the past month, Royal Order’s been away in Canterlot. He was apparently even offered vacations, but turned them down.",
Twilight,Any idea why he’s been away for so long?,
Fair Devotion,"It’s more of a recent development, if I’m being honest. My husband’s job has kept him busier than usual lately.",
Turning,"He used to come home to us whenever he had the chance. He looked forward to it, he told me.",
Athena,Did he ever talk to you about it? Or say anything about why he’d been spending so much time away?,
Turning,Well—,
Fair Devotion,No. Not really. He kept his reasons to himself.,sfx-punch2.wav
Turning,Y-Yeah…,sfx-huhlow.wav
Athena,(There’s no doubt about it. She’s hiding something.),
Athena,"(Turning seems like he may know the reason, but as long as Fair’s here, we’re not going to get it out of him.)",
Fair Devotion,"Because he spent so much time away, Canterlot had almost become like a second home to him. He had a travel case prepared for every time he had to go.",
Phoenix,A… travel case?,sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,Is there any chance we could see it?,
Fair Devotion,"I’m afraid not. It was seized by the police yesterday. According to that gentlecolt investigator, it was important evidence.",
Twilight,You mean Private Eye?,
Fair Devotion,"Ah, yes, I believe that was his name. You’ll have to ask him about it.",
Twilight,We’ll make sure to do that.,
Athena,"(That was weird. Ms. Devotion acted like she couldn’t remember his name, but I didn’t detect any hint of sudden recognition when Twilight mentioned it.)",
Trucy,"Hey, Daddy?",
Phoenix,"Yeah, Trucy?",
Trucy,You know what today’s date is?,
Phoenix,"The… date? Well, it’s February 14th. Why?",sfx-huh.wav
Athena,"(Of all the places for Mr. Wright to start, it’s NOT gonna be here, Trucy.)",
Trucy,"I know what you’re thinking, Athena! But it’s not about that! I just noticed something, and wanted to know if I was right!",sfx-punch2.wav
Athena,S-sorry! Um.. what was it you noticed?,
Trucy,This calendar hanging on the wall!,
Trucy,See? There’s a date circled in red here—today’s date.,
Trucy,"Did you… plan on doing something with your husband today, Ms. Devotion?",
Athena,"I mean, it IS Valentine’s Day, after all.",
Twilight,You mean Hearts and Hooves Day?,
Athena,Hearts and… Hooves Day?,sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,"Yes. It’s a holiday where you give special attention to ponies you appreciate, or your special somepony.",
Athena,Special… somepony?,sfx-huhhigh.wav
Twilight,"It’s basically a term you’d use to refer to somepony you’re dating or in a relationship with. On Hearts and Hooves Day, you’d see a lot of couples giving gifts to their partners.",
Athena,So… it’s exactly like Valentine’s Day.,sfx-huhlow.wav
Fair Devotion,In regards to your question: yes. I did have plans for today. Royal and I were going to go to a fancy restaurant for dinner.,
Fair Devotion,"But, I had to cancel it, after that whole incident with Spoiled Rich.",
Scootaloo,Was that why no one was home when I came to get Turning two nights ago?,
Fair Devotion,"Yes. I was out at the time, cancelling my dinner reservations. I had hoped to reschedule it for a later date, but, obviously…",
Fair Devotion,That doesn’t matter anymore.,
Turning,Hmph! How dare that mare demand ANYTHING from us! After what her daughter did? I oughta—,
Fair Devotion,Turning Page! That is quite enough of your outbursts!,sfx-hit1.wav
Turning,"But Mom, surely you can see that it wasn’t right—",
Fair Devotion,"Yes, and it also wasn’t right to attack those fillies, either. Need I remind you of what it led to?",sfx-furious.wav
Turning,"Y-you’re right. It… it IS kind of my fault, isn’t it? I mean, you had to cancel your dinner plans, and then Father… he…",
Trucy,"I’m so sorry, Ms. Devotion. I didn’t mean to drag up sad memories.",
Fair Devotion,It’s… all right. We’ll manage. We’ll find a way. We always have.,
Turning,"But what about Ms. Stamp? I feel bad about that, too.",
Twilight,Huh? Why’s that?,sfx-huh.wav
Fair Devotion,Turning—,
Turning,"Well, because she and my mom were childhood friends. She’s probably the closest pony to her!",
Athena,"Really? Is that true, Ms. Devotion?",
Fair Devotion,"Y-yes, it is. We… we’re close.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,Huh?,sfx-huh.wav
Athena,(Seriously? She’s hesitant to even say THAT? What gives?),
Fair Devotion,"In any case, I think we should let these kids rest. They’ve had a long day.",
Fair Devotion,"Thank you for coming to check up on us, but I do think you had better get going. I wouldn’t want to impede your investigation any further.",
Fair Devotion,"Rainbow Dash, why don’t you take Scootaloo home?",
Rainbow,"U-uh, s-sure, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. We’ll actually head back to the castle. If you guys need us, that’s where we’ll be. You ready, squirt?",
Scootaloo,"Just… one more thing. Twilight, Athena?",
Twilight,"Yes, Scootaloo? What is it?",
Scootaloo,"Just… please. Regardless of how hurt I feel, please find a way to help Sweetie Belle.",
Athena,"We’ll try, Scootaloo. Until the very end.",
Phoenix,"Well, that was… abrupt.",
Athena,"And we aren’t much closer to the truth, either. By the way, did anyone else get the feeling that Ms. Devotion’s hiding something?",
Trucy,"No, she is. Definitely. But what could it be? And why?",
Athena,If it could help us figure out what really happened to Royal Order… I don’t know why she would keep it to herself. Unless…,
Phoenix,Are you thinking that she might be involved in his death?,
Athena,I… don’t know. She might just be trying to protect someone.,
Twilight,"Whatever the case, I don’t think Fair Devotion’s about to tell us what she knows. At least, not at the moment.",
Athena,"I guess that’s true. Where to next, then, Twilight?",
Twilight,I think we’d better go and visit Diamond Tiara’s house. I can’t say I’m really looking forward to that.,
Athena,"Me, neither. But, yeah, let’s get going.",
Sugar Stamp,"Knowing that Turning Page and his friend had been at the castle ruins, I knew I could pin the murder on them AND make the ruins look like the real murder scene.",
Sugar Stamp,"It’s what Royal Order deserved, after what he did to me.",
Athena,But—,
Luna,"Defense, while I appreciate your habit of needling into every single minor point in each testimony, my patience is beginning to wear thin.",
Luna,"Besides, the witness has already provided a reason for what she did: to get back at Royal Order for choosing to clone himself instead of being with her.",
Luna,"As disconcerting as that may sound, THAT is the motive we have been given. Unless you can offer something to refute or change it, I suggest you move on.",
Athena,"Rrgh… Fine. I just have one more question, Sugar Stamp.",
Sugar Stamp,What is it?,
Athena,"After you’d moved the scooter and wagon to the castle ruins, you must have flown back towards the forest entrance, passing over the crossroads along the way.",
Athena,"But the other Royal Order wasn’t there, right?",
Sugar Stamp,"No, he wasn’t. I went to look for him, and that was when I saw what happened at the statue.",
Athena,"(When she saw Sweetie Belle trip Royal Order, supposedly…)",
Athena,"(That still bothers me, but unless I can prove that that isn’t what she saw, this won’t get me anywhere. And Luna knows it.)",
Judge,Let’s return to the witness testimony.,
Sugar Stamp,"As to what I did at the castle before I saw the crash, I removed the letter opener and put it in my bag. Then I went to deliver the letter.",
Athena,Ms. Sugar Stamp!,
Athena,"You’re saying that you removed the letter opener—the one that had been stemming the blood flow from the victim’s wound—from the body, and placed it in your bag?",
Athena,And you did this BEFORE you delivered the letter?,
Sugar Stamp,Y-yes! W-why? Is there something wrong?,
Athena,You bet there’s something wrong with that statement! There’s a clear contradiction!,
Sugar Stamp,A c-contradiction?!,
Luna,"On what grounds, defense? The witness clearly described her actions that night.",
Luna,"She killed Royal Order, disposed of his armor, and moved the body—letter opener and all—to the castle, all to pin the crime on Turning Page and Scootaloo.",
Luna,"Afterwards, she flew back to Zecora’s hut, in order to deliver that letter. I see no contradictions in her movements!",
Athena,"It’s not her movements that are contradictory. It’s the letter that was in her bag. Or more accurately, the envelope!",
Judge,The envelope?,
Athena,"Sugar Stamp says she placed the letter opener in her bag after she’d moved the body, and that after doing so, she went to deliver the letter.",
Athena,"If that’s the case, we can reasonably assume that the letter, or rather, the envelope containing it, was ALSO in her bag.",
Athena,"But if THAT’S the case, then we’d expect to see something else—",
Athena,"After all, look at the inside of the bag—it’s coated in blood from the weapon. Yet, when we look at the envelope… THERE’S NOT A SINGLE TRACE OF BLOOD!",
Sugar Stamp,AGH!,sfx-stab.wav
Fair Devotion,!!!,sfx-lightbulb_alt.wav
Luna,"If that’s the contradiction, defense, color me not impressed in the slightest! The witness could simply have gotten the time she delivered the letter mixed up!",
Sugar Stamp,"Y-yes! That’s it! I must have delivered the letter BEFORE I took out the letter opener from the body! So, before I arrived at the castle ruins!",
Athena,"Sorry, but that just isn’t possible!",
Sugar Stamp,Wah!,
Luna,"Explain, defense!",
Athena,Do you remember what we uncovered yesterday regarding when the letter was delivered?,
Athena,"*** First, the fact that we found this letter in the first place tells us that Zecora hadn’t yet retrieved it.",
Athena,"According to a friend of hers, Zecora would’ve collected her mail from earlier that day as soon as it was delivered.",
Athena,"This tells us that on the day of the murder, this letter wasn’t in the mailbox. If it was, Zecora would’ve collected it when she returned to her hut that night.",
Luna,"Then when, pray tell, was it delivered?",
Athena,"That leads to my second point, Prosecutor Luna!",
Athena,"When we found this letter yesterday, we also found the mail that had been delivered that morning. That mail was in far better condition than this letter.",
Athena,"So, this letter must have been delivered BEFORE yesterday’s mail, and had gotten dirtied as a result.",
Athena,"Knowing that, and knowing that it hadn’t been in the mailbox when Zecora returned to her hut…",
Athena,*** … we can conclude that this letter arrived on the NIGHT of the murder itself!,
Judge,"Hrm… Why, yes, I actually DO recall that!",
Athena,"(Are you… surprised, or something?)",
Judge,"It was established that the letter could only have arrived that night, and not anytime prior, wasn’t it?",
Athena,"Right! But if you’ll also recall, Zecora testified that she’d waited for Scootaloo and Turning Page to return for about half an hour, from 9:45 to 10:10pm.",
Athena,"By 10:15, she had returned to her hut, and was just about to turn in, she heard a clanging sound, and so she went out to investigate.",
Twilight,"Furthermore, we also learned yesterday that Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon ALSO heard a clanging sound, at the exact same time: 10:15.",
Athena,"10:15 was when Sugar Stamp killed Royal Order. She said she did so by kicking him hard in the side to stagger him, then stabbing him in the head.",
Athena,"Her kicking him made a loud, metallic sound—",
Twilight,"Which was most likely the clang that Zecora, Diamond Tiara, and Silver Spoon heard!",
Sugar Stamp,Gnk!,
Athena,"Therefore, the murder occurred RIGHT BEFORE Zecora left her hut. Meaning that the letter could ONLY have been delivered AFTER she’d left—not before!",
Athena,"Thus, the letter would have been in the bag with the bloody letter opener, rendering the idea that the envelope got no traces of blood on it IMPOSSIBLE!",
Luna,Ghk!!!,
Judge,"I-indeed, but then, why does no blood exist on the envelope?",
Luna,"Defense, you don’t mean to say…",
Athena,"I do, Prosecutor Luna. Your Honor, we agree that it’s impossible for there to be no blood on this envelope, correct?",
Judge,"Y-yes, I find it a perplexing situation!",
Athena,"True, and one that we can solve if we just consider one other possibility…",
Athena,"At the time that the letter was in the bag, the letter opener did NOT have any blood on it at any point.",
Judge,It didn’t have any blood on it…? But how can that be?!,
Athena,Because of one simple fact: the letter opener was NOT used to kill Royal Order. It’s just a fabricated piece of evidence used to support Sugar Stamp’s story!!!,
Judge,W-W-WHAT?!,
Twilight,"!! A-and, if that’s the case, t-then, Sugar Stamp’s confession, about her killing Royal Order and pinning the blame on the kids…",
Athena,Exactly. Her confession… is a complete and utter fabrication in and of itself!,
Sugar Stamp,AAAAAAAAAGGHHH!!!,
Judge,O-Order! ORDER IN THE COURT! M-Ms. Cykes! T-this is astounding! You mean to say that this witness has been lying to the court this whole time?,
Athena,"I am, Your Honor.",
Luna,OBJECTION! Defense! That is absolutely preposterous of you to claim! Need I remind you that the blood found ON the letter opener matched Royal Order’s?,
Luna,It could only have gotten there when the witness stabbed him with it!,
Athena,"OBJECTION! That doesn’t explain why the envelope has no blood on it! So long as that contradiction exists, we cannot accept that the letter opener was the murder weapon!",
Judge,"I am inclined to agree, Prosecutor Luna. The WHEN is not as important as the WHY, here.",
Luna,Then perhaps we need to clarify both questions.,
Athena,H-Huh?,
Judge,What do you mean?,
Luna,"Your Honor, I believe now would be a good time for us to re-summon the lead detective, Private Eye,  to the stand.",
Luna,He should be able to clarify once and for all these details surrounding the letter opener and the blood found on it.,
Judge,"Yes, that would make sense. Very well. Let Private Eye back onto the witness stand, please.",
Athena,"(He looks nervous, as expected.)",
Private Eye,"Forgive me, My Lord, but for what reason have I been summoned?",
Judge,Prosecutor Luna has requested that you provide testimony.,
Private Eye,!! She has? A-About what?,
Luna,We would like you to testify regarding the forensics surrounding the murder weapon—the letter opener.,
Luna,"The Golden Pixie has suggested that it cannot be the murder weapon. You are to demonstrate why it MUST be, detective.",
Private Eye,I… I see.,
Private Eye,Very well. If it would please the court…,
Sugar Stamp,"Knowing that Turning Page and his friend had been at the castle ruins, I knew I could pin the murder on them AND make the ruins look like the real murder scene.",

Sugar Stamp,"Y-yes! That’s it! I must have delivered the letter BEFORE I took out the letter opener from the body! So, before I arrived at the castle ruins!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,"Sorry, but that just isn’t possible!",
Sugar Stamp,Wah!,sfx-stab.wav
Luna,"Explain, defense!",sfx-bigshock.wav
Private Eye,"Truthfully, it’s a rather open-and-shut matter. The blood found on the letter opener belonged to the victim, meaning it MUST be the murder weapon.",
Private Eye,"More than that, though, if you take a look at the head wound, you’ll find that it matches the shape of the letter opener.",
Private Eye,"The helmet was found at the river’s mouth of Froggy Bottom Bog. It has a hole matching the size of the weapon, further supporting Ms. Sugar Stamp’s testimony.",
Private Eye,"If it’s all a lie, then the blood, wound, and helmet would all have to be some sort of... fabrication!",sfx-bigshock.wav
Luna,"You see, Golden Pixie? The facts are irrefutable! No matter how you look at it, that letter opener IS the murder weapon, meaning Sugar Stamp IS the true killer!","sfx-punch2.wav,sfx-punch2.wav"
Athena,"I’m not so sure about that, Prosecutor Luna. We’ve already established her testimony is suspect at best.",
Athena,Wouldn’t it be wrong of us to assume ALL the supposed “facts” are irrefutable?,sfx-huh.wav
Luna,…,
Luna,So you still intend to go down this route…?,
Athena,I do.,
Luna,…,
Luna,I see…,
Judge,"Thank you for your testimony, detective. Defense, you may begin your cross-examination.",
Athena,"(Both the hole in the helmet and the wound match the letter opener, and the blood matches the victim’s.)",
Athena,"(So, if the letter opener is fake evidence… How would all of that be possible?)",sfx-huh.wav
Athena,(There’s only one thing I can think of…),
Private Eye,"Truthfully, it’s a rather open-and-shut matter. The blood found on the letter opener belonged to the victim, meaning it MUST be the murder weapon.",
Athena,How do we know for certain the blood belonged to the victim?,
Private Eye,"Because, Ms. Cykes, several ponies tested it individually— there’s no doubting the same consensus being reached by so many.",
Athena,"I, uh… Y-yeah, I guess that’s fair…",sfx-stab2.wav
Luna,"Surely you knew this already, Golden Pixie. Why are you insisting on this useless prattling?",
Athena,(It’s not useless! It’s the tried-and-true method of the Wright Anything Agency!),
Athena,"Ahem! P-Private Eye, the blood may match the victim’s, but that alone isn’t enough to prove that the letter opener is the murder weapon.",
Private Eye,"I would agree with that, Ms. Cykes. Which is why…",
Private Eye,"More than that, though, if you take a look at the head wound, you’ll find that it matches the shape of the letter opener.",
Athena,So you’re saying that the wound’s shape matches that of the letter opener’s? How can you be so certain?,
Private Eye,"After we found the letter opener in Ms. Sugar Stamp’s bag in Canterlot, along with the blood, we conducted two tests.",
Private Eye,"The first was the blood test, which came back positive for Royal Order.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,The second involved examining the wound itself to look for any notable characteristics which might match a certain weapon.,
Athena,And what were some of those notable characteristics?,
Private Eye,One was the presence of track marks found in the victim’s head.,
Athena,Track marks?,sfx-huh.wav
Private Eye,"Yes. These are the marks that a stabbing weapon, such as a knife, might leave when it is thrust into a body.",
Private Eye,"If the weapon has a distinct styling to it, it’ll leave trace impressions.",
Private Eye,"Within the wound, we managed to find SEVERAL impressions that matched those found on the letter opener in Ms. Sugar Stamp’s bag.",sfx-lightbulb_alt.wav
Private Eye,"Along with that, on the outside of the wound, we did not find a hilt impression.",
Private Eye,"The letter opener does not have a hilt, so that is another match.",
Private Eye,"Though, not quite as substantial as the previous one, admittedly.",
Athena,Gngh! I-I guess that would be... pretty indicative of it being the weapon…,sfx-stab.wav
Athena,"(So, that proves the body was actually stabbed WITH the letter opener. No use trying to debunk that. The question is… WHEN did that happen?)",sfx-huh.wav
Luna,"Let’s continue. Detective, what else supports Sugar Stamp’s confession?",
Private Eye,"The helmet was found at the river’s mouth of Froggy Bottom Bog. It has a hole matching the size of the weapon, further supporting Ms. Sugar Stamp’s testimony.",
Athena,"But only the helmet itself was found, right?",
Private Eye,That’s correct.,
Athena,But not the armor. Wouldn’t the armor be a stronger contender for supporting her testimony?,
Private Eye,"It would… But, as I understand it, Ms. Sugar Stamp testified that she disposed of the entire armor set in the river.",
Private Eye,"Given that we found the helmet at the mouth of the river, it seems logical to assume the rest flowed out into the bog, and sank.",
Athena,"Which would support Sugar’s testimony, but…",
Athena,"At the same time, it conveniently removes the need to prove, definitively, that the rest of the armor was there at all, doesn’t it?",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,…,
Private Eye,"The helmet was there, which matches Sugar Stamp’s testimony, suggesting it’s the truth. And if it isn’t…",
Private Eye,"If it’s all a lie, then the blood, wound, and helmet would all have to be some sort of... fabrication!",
Athena,"Some sort of fabrication, you say? I assume you don’t mean that the HELMET would have to be fake.",
Private Eye,"No, that would be a bit much. I suppose I mean that some other aspect of it would have to be fabricated, if not the helmet itself.",
Athena,"Some other aspect? Like, say, where it was found? Or, perhaps more specifically...",
Athena,How it was BROUGHT to where it was found?,
Private Eye,"I… I suppose that could be o-one way, yes…",
Luna,"Golden Pixie, don’t tell me you’re suggesting…",
Athena,"So you admit it could be a possibility, detective? Instead of getting there by river, that helmet could’ve been carried to the scene and placed there?",
Private Eye,"No, that’s… quite impossible, Ms. Cykes!",
Athena,Oh? And why would that be?,
Private Eye,"The bog itself, where the helmet was found, was not considered relevant until the end of the previous trial. It was sealed off once that was determined.",
Private Eye,"For somepony to have brought it there for us to find, they would have had to bypass that seal. An impossibility, I’m afraid.",
Athena,"Is that right… Private Eye, could you amend your testimony and add what you just said?",
Private Eye,"C-certainly, Ms. Cykes.",
Private Eye,"No one knew the bog was related to the crime scene until the previous trial, after which it was sealed off. Nopony could have entered to plant the helmet.",
Athena,"Private Eye, I’m sorry to say that you’re completely wrong about that last statement.",
Private Eye,I-is that so?,
Athena,It’s true that the bog was sealed off at the end of the previous trial. But it’s not true that nopony could have gotten in.,
Athena,ONE pony in particular would have had access to the scene.,
Athena,"And, by having access, they would have had the chance to bring the helmet there to plant it, all in order to support Sugar Stamp’s testimony.",
Luna,!,sfx-lightbulb_alt.wav
Luna,Y-You don’t mean—,
Judge,"Ms. Cykes, who could this pony be?",
Athena,"There’s only one answer, Your Honor. It’s the pony who ordered that the bog be sealed off in the first place.",
Athena,PRIVATE EYE!!,sfx-shouting.wav
Twilight,P-P—,
Judge,PRIVATE EYE?!,sfx-shocked.wav
Private Eye,GNGH!,sfx-damage.wav
Judge,"Order, order, order!",
Judge,"Ms. Cykes, I am starting to get tired of these repeated accusations towards every witness!",
Luna,"As am I, Your Honor! Not only is this a reckless act, it is completely impossible!",
Athena,"Why is that, Prosecutor Luna?",
Luna,You claim that the detective brought the helmet to the bog himself? How?,sfx-punch2.wav
Luna,His fellow officers were on the scene—they would no doubt have noticed if he’d brought the helmet with him!,
Athena,That’s true—they WOULD have been able to notice.,sfx-huh.wav
Athena,"But, what if they had no reason to? No reason to think he was carrying the helmet with him?",
Luna,"What are you blabbering on about, defense?",
Athena,"When Private Eye and his team went to the scene, he had in his possession something that he could’ve used to conceal the helmet.",
Judge,The… The victim’s travel case?!,
Athena,"Private was the one who brought this case to the scene that day. He ordered that the forest be sealed off, and opened only when he arrived.",
Athena,"Meaning, Private Eye could have easily stashed the helmet inside this case prior to arriving at the forest, bringing it along with no one the wiser!",
Luna,T-This is absurd!,
Athena,"If it’s so absurd, then let’s ask the witness himself!",
Private Eye,W-what in Equestria do you want me to say?!,sfx-damage.wav
Athena,"Well, why don’t you repeat to the court your actions in the forest that day, including when you had the travel case with you? That should clear everything up.",
Private Eye,…,
Athena,Not going to? That’s fine. I think I’ve got a good enough handle on your movements to describe what you did.,
Athena,You and your team of investigators first went to the bog.,
Athena,"You had the travel case with you, because you had taken it from the police station after we requested to see it. Once you got it, you stashed the helmet inside.",
Athena,"When you arrived at the bog, and while your team was busy investigating, you planted the helmet at the mouth of the river so that it would be found later.",
Athena,"Then, you and your team went into the Mirror Pool cavern. You placed the travel case there, open, on the cave floor, to show us when we arrived!",
Athena,"THAT’S how the helmet ended up being planted—and how, as you said, it was a fabrication!",sfx-hit1.wav
Athena,"And that means that it no longer supports Sugar Stamp’s testimony. Which, itself, can now also be considered a complete FABRICATION!",sfx-shouting.wav
Private Eye,Ungh!,sfx-stab2.wav
Luna,"N-No! I refuse to accept this, defense! There’s still one thing you haven’t explained—the one thing that your entire theory is predicated on!",sfx-stab.wav
Athena,One thing?,sfx-huh.wav
Luna,The blood on the letter opener!,
Luna,All this time you’ve claimed that it’s not the murder weapon. And now you’ve claimed that this helmet is also fake!,
Luna,"If it IS fake, how do you explain the blood?",
Athena,…,
Athena,"All right, Prosecutor Luna. I’ve got the evidence that explains that bloodstain right here!",
Private Eye,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,T-that’s—,
Luna,"Defense, what is that?!",
Athena,"This is a blood sample I requested Private Eye give me while we were waiting in the lobby before today’s trial. It contains the blood of the victim, Royal Order.",
Athena,"Now, I’d asked Private Eye to get this blood sample in secret. The fact that it’s here proves he certainly can conceal his movements. But let me ask this:",
Athena,Where would Private Eye have to go in order to get the blood sample of a deceased murder victim?,sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,Probably wherever the body had been autopsied…,
Athena,"And where would that be, Prosecutor Luna?",
Luna,C-Canterlot…,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,"Exactly. Royal Order WAS a member of the royal guard, after all. So Canterlot was where he was undergoing an autopsy. And Canterlot…",
Twilight,"Was also where Private Eye and his team apprehended Sugar Stamp, as well as where they discovered the bloody letter opener.",
Athena,"If he had the helmet with him while in Canterlot and got hold of a letter opener before arresting Sugar Stamp, then it would’ve been possible for him…",
Twilight,"…to put the helmet on the body and stab it with the letter opener, leaving the hole in the helmet and a bloody weapon as “proof” that she’d killed Royal Order!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,And THAT’S why the scene was sealed off until Private Eye returned from Canterlot!,
Athena,It was so he had all the time he needed to fabricate evidence to support Sugar Stamp’s story!,
Luna,"Very elaborate, Golden Pixie! So you say that the entirety of Sugar Stamp’s story is a complete lie, one that our dear detective helped to create?",
Athena,"I am, Prosecutor Luna.",
Luna,Then what of the planner? Doesn’t THAT support the fact that Ms. Stamp really DID meet with Royal Order that night?,
Athena,"Well, that’s what we’ve been thinking, at least. But something about that planner has been bugging me.",
Judge,And what is that?,
Athena,"Your Honor, the defense has just proven that the legitimacy of two pieces of evidence—the helmet and the letter opener—have to be called into question.",
Athena,"In large part, that is because of their association with Private Eye. This planner also shares that characteristic.",
Judge,I-It does?,
Luna,Ms. Cykes… You mean to say…! But that would mean—,
Athena,"Your Honor, this planner did not undergo testing by an entire forensic team.",
Athena,"Instead, it has been tested by only one pony...",
Athena,Private Eye himself.,
Judge,My word!,
Athena,"Your Honor, at this time I do not think we can trust this witness’s words as to the legitimacy of all the pieces of evidence he’s handled.",
Athena,"As such, the defense requests that the planner be re-tested immediately, and the horn-writing inside be compared to that of both Royal Order and Private Eye.",
Judge,I agree! That is definitely the best course of action!,
Judge,"Prosecutor Luna, do you have any objections?",
Judge,Uh... Prosecutor Luna?,sfx-huhhigh.wav
Luna,W-what? I mean…,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Luna,"The prosecution… has no objections to the defense’s request, Your Honor.",
Judge,"Very well. Bailiff, see to it that the planner be re-tested.",
Judge,"Well, then. Prosecutor Luna, have the planner and hornwriting been tested?",
Luna,"They have, Your Honor.",
Judge,And what are the results?,
Luna,The horn-writing in the planner…,
Luna,"...does not match that of Royal Order, but rather, that of Private Eye.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,N-no!,sfx-bigshock.wav
Athena,"There you have it, Your Honor!",
Athena,"Definitive proof that not only did Private Eye tamper with the facts of this case, but also, that Sugar Stamp’s story cannot be taken as the truth!",
Judge,Witness! What do you have to say for yourself?!,sfx-angry.wav
Private Eye,W-well now… That is… I…,
Athena,F-Fair Devotion?!,sfx-stab.wav
Fair Devotion,"You are as persistent now as you were yesterday, Ms. Cykes. It’s almost admirable.",
Athena,A-Almost?,sfx-huh.wav
Athena,(W-what’s with her all of a sudden? She seems colder…),
Fair Devotion,"Your Honor, I think I can explain, at the very least, why Sugar Stamp’s story has so many problems with it.",
Athena,Y-You can?!,sfx-huh.wav
Judge,But… How? The defense has just proven that it’s all a lie!,
Fair Devotion,"It’s not a lie, Your Honor, but… I do believe that it’s a story affected by all the events of that night.",
Judge,A-affected by…,
Fair Devotion,"I’m sure I don’t have to point out that seeing the murder was… a traumatic experience, for... all of those involved.",
Fair Devotion,"Sugar Stamp may not be able to remember all of the details clearly, such as… the actual weapon she used to commit the crime.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Sugar Stamp,It’s true that my memory of that night is a little fuzzy… But I remember one thing for certain.,
Sugar Stamp,I killed Royal Order. I KNOW I did.,sfx-hit1.wav
Judge,"Y-yes, I suppose that it is reasonable to assume some degree of… memory loss occurred.",
Fair Devotion,"I can also explain the detective’s actions, though he’d need to see if I am correct.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Private Eye,I would?,
Fair Devotion,"Private Eye must have known of Sugar’s guilt, but aside from her confession, he did not have the right amount of evidence to support it.",
Fair Devotion,"With no way to prove her guilt, he decided he would have to take matters into his own hooves. And that’s why…",
Private Eye,I see… My Lord.,
Judge,"Y-yes, detective?",
Private Eye,"It… pains me to have to admit this, but… What Ms. Devotion has just postulated...",
Private Eye,Was indeed my thought process.,
Judge,WHAT?! S-so you’re saying…,sfx-shocked.wav
Athena,Y-you’re really saying…,
Private Eye,It’s true. Every word. I confess.,
Private Eye,"I planted the helmet, and fabricated the weapon, as the defense stated. This was done for two reasons…",
Private Eye,To bring justice to Royal Order…,
Private Eye,And to prove the guilt of the true killer…,
Private Eye,Sugar Stamp.,
Athena,"Your Honor, at this point, the defense…",
Athena,Would like to step down from defending Sweetie Belle.,sfx-shocked.wav
Twilight,A-Athena—!!,sfx-damage.wav
Luna,Y-Y-You would—,sfx-stab.wav
Sweetie,W-W-WHAT?!!,sfx-angry.wav
Sweetie,A-Athena! W-What are you doing?!,sfx-stab2.wav
Judge,"That’s what I’d like to know! Ms. Cykes, what ARE you doing?!",sfx-punch2.wav
Luna,Have you lost your mind?! You can’t just step down now!,sfx-furious.wav
Athena,"Actually, I can, Prosecutor Luna. I retain the right to decide who I defend, and who I do not.",
Sweetie,B-But you can’t! W-what’s gonna happen to me if you don’t defend me?!,sfx-bigshock.wav
Athena,"I’d imagine that you’ll be found guilty, thanks to the testimonies of Sugar Stamp and Fair Devotion.",
Fair Devotion,Ms. Cykes! Don’t you think this is a bit rash?,sfx-punch2.wav
Sugar Stamp,Deva’s right! You… You can’t just quit now!,sfx-damage.wav
Athena,"Fair Devotion, you’ve already testified to having seen Sweetie Belle accidentally kill Royal Order.",
Athena,"The same goes for you too, Sugar Stamp. Neither of you can back out now.",
,!!,sfx-bigshock.wav
Luna,"Athena! You can’t do this to Sweetie Belle! She’s just a filly, for goodness’ sake! Have you thought this through at ALL?",
Athena,"I have, Prosecutor Luna, believe me. And I can assure you that this is the only way for us to find the truth. The REAL truth.",sfx-hit1.wav
Luna,But abandoning her—,
Athena,"If Sweetie Belle is willing to testify, then I’ll remain as her defense.",
Sweetie,!!!,sfx-lightbulb_alt.wav
Athena,But I can’t help somepony who won’t even help themselves.,
Luna,…,
Luna,Ms. Cykes…,
Athena,"Please, Prosecutor Luna. I know this seems reckless of me, but I can assure you, I know what I’m doing. I KNOW this is the way forward. The only way.",
Athena,Please? Trust me.,
Luna,"I… I will try, Ms. Cykes.",
Sweetie,"W-what?! E-even you, Princess Luna?",sfx-stab.wav
Luna,"I am sorry, little one. But she raises a fair point. And it appears you must make a decision.",
Luna,"Either you testify… or the defense formally steps down, and the prosecution does its duty.",
Sweetie,N-ngh! P-Princess Twilight!,sfx-damage.wav
Twilight,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Sweetie,P-Please! You gotta help me! Don’t let Athena do this!,
Twilight,I…,
Athena,"Twilight... I know what this looks like, but we HAVE to hear from Sweetie Belle somehow.",
Athena,This… This was the only way I could think of.,
Twilight,...,
Twilight,"Yes, you’re right. We HAVE to hear from her.",
Athena,Does that mean…,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Sweetie,P-Princess Twilight…?,
Twilight,"Your Honor, the co-counsel for the defense agrees with this decision. As such…",
Twilight,Unless Sweetie Belle chooses to testify… the defense will step down.,
Sweetie,"N-No, please, no…",
Judge,Hrm… This is all rather unconventional.,
Luna,"These are unconventional times, Your Honor… And sometimes they call for unconventional methods.",
Judge,So they do… Very well. The court accepts the defense’s decision to step down—,
,!!,"sfx-huh.wav,sfx-huhhigh.wav,sfx-huhhigher.wav"
Athena,…,
Sweetie,...,
Sweetie,Fine. I’ll do it.,
Sweetie,I’ll testify.,
Judge,Ms. Cykes. I take it this means you will continue on as the defendant’s lawyer?,
Athena,"I will, Your Honor.",
Judge,"Duly noted. Now, Prosecutor Luna. Do you have any objections to hearing the defendant testify?",
Luna,"I do not, Your Honor.",
Judge,"Good. In which case, I call for a twenty minute recess to allow all parties prepare themselves.",
Judge,"When we reconvene, we will hear Sweetie Belle’s testimony.",
Sweetie,And hope you don’t regret it…,
Athena,…,
Judge,Court is adjourned!,
Luna,This anonymous tip… You must mean the one Ms. Sugar Stamp wrote and delivered. The one implicating the deceased’s son.,
Athena,"I am, Prosecutor Luna.",
Athena,"However, I think you’ll find that it’s far too soon for us to definitively say that Ms. Sugar Stamp is responsible for writing and sending it.",
Luna,"Why is that, defense?",
Athena,Because of this.,
Luna,Another magazine?,sfx-huh.wav
Athena,"That’s right. But this isn’t just an ordinary magazine. If you flip through it, you’ll see that a few pages have been cut out.",
Athena,"Before this trial began, I had a friend test those cut-outs against the ones found on the anonymous tip. And she found that they were a perfect match.",
Judge,A perfect match?!,sfx-huh.wav
Luna,Where was this magazine discovered?,
Athena,…,
Athena,In the home of Diamond Tiara.,
Diamond,!!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Silver Spoon,…,
Luna,W-what—,sfx-damage.wav
Judge,Did you say—DIAMOND TIARA?!,sfx-shocked.wav
Judge,Order! Order in the court! You mean to say that Diamond Tiara is the true sender of the tip?,
Judge,Witness! What do you have to say for yourself?,sfx-punch2.wav
Diamond,Wah! I—I don’t know! I-I’ve never even seen that magazine in my life!,sfx-stab.wav
Luna,"Yet it was found in your house, according to the defense. Do you deny that?",
Diamond,Well… no… but… I don’t know anything about it!,
Athena,"I know this looks bad for Diamond Tiara, but, Your Honor, it’s actually impossible for her to be the one who sent the tip in the first place.",
Judge,"Impossible? But the magazine! If it was found in her house, and if it matches the tip, then she must have sent it!",sfx-huh.wav
Athena,Not quite. Take a look at this photo.,
Athena,It’s a picture of where this magazine was found—in the trashcan of Diamond Tiara’s bedroom.,
Luna,"Defense, do you mean to say that you were… digging around in some filly’s trash?",
Athena,N-not me! My boss—but that’s besides the point!,sfx-stab2.wav
Athena,"Your Honor, when you look at this photo, what do you see underneath the magazine?",
Judge,"Hmm… Oh! Why, it’s a Hearts and Hooves Day envelope! How lovely!",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,(How long did this guy stay here last time he was in Equestria?),sfx-whoops.wav
Athena,"Exactly, Your Honor. That’s why it’s impossible for Diamond Tiara to have sent this.",
Judge,…,
Judge,"I’m afraid you’ve lost me, defense.",
Athena,The placement of the envelope tells us it was thrown away before this magazine.,
Athena,That envelope could only have been thrown away on Hearts and Hooves Day—February 14th.,
Athena,"We know that the tip was delivered on the 13th, because that was the day that Turning Page was arrested.",
Athena,"So, it doesn’t make sense for the magazine to be on top of the envelope.",
Athena,That means it’s impossible that Diamond Tiara COULD have sent the tip—she’d have sent it too late!,
Diamond,"Exactly! Finally, you said something smart!",
Athena,Hey! Would it kill you to be a LITTLE grateful?,sfx-bigshock.wav
Judge,"I see… but, then, how do we explain the fact that the magazine was found in her bedroom?",
Twilight,"Well, it couldn’t have been stashed there by the pony who said she sent it: Sugar Stamp. She’d already been arrested by the time she arrived in Ponyville.",
Luna,"Logically, that means the sender must be somepony who was IN Diamond Tiara’s bedroom. Someone who’d be able to discard the magazine while there.",
Luna,Ms. Diamond Tiara?,
Diamond,"Urk! W-what is it, Princess Luna?",
Luna,"Between today and yesterday, was there anypony present in your house who could have disposed of this magazine?",
Diamond,Uh… uh…,
Judge,"Witness, it’s in your best interest to be honest with the court.",
Diamond,"W-well… w-when S-Silvie came to my house yesterday, she… was carrying a magazine…",
Silver Spoon,!!,sfx-lightbulb_alt.wav
Silver Spoon,"D-DT, wait!",
Judge,T-then that means that Ms. Silver Spoon could be the true sender…,
Athena,"Except for one thing, Your Honor.",
Athena,"The tip was delivered around 4:45pm on the 13th, when Silver Spoon was busy getting her glasses replaced. So you see, she COULDN’T have sent it.",
Judge,But she still had the magazine in question! It was STILL used to write the tip!,
Luna,"If she wasn’t the one to deliver it, then she might have been given it by the true author… Is that what you’re thinking, Ms. Cykes?",
Silver Spoon,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,Diamond Tiara.,
Diamond,W-what now?!,
Athena,"I know you’re scared for Silver Spoon. But figuring out what we can about this magazine is crucial to helping her, even if you can’t see it.",
Athena,Do you remember any details about Silver Spoon when she brought the magazine to your house? Anything at all?,
Diamond,I… I… Gnngh…,sfx-damage.wav
Silver Spoon,"DT, please…",
Athena,"Please, Diamond Tiara! I know I have no right to ask this of you, but there’s a way to protect Silver Spoon—and it depends on what you’re able to tell us.",
Diamond,O-Okay! Fine!,sfx-angry.wav
Silver Spoon,"DT, hang on a—",
Diamond,"Not now, Silvie! Just trust me, okay? I’m doing this for your sake!",sfx-punch2.wav
Silver Spoon,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Silver Spoon,D-Diamond…,
Diamond,"When Silvie came into my bedroom with the magazine, I saw that she had a small patch of her coat that was… stained red.",
Athena,!!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Judge,"Stained red? With blood, I would presume?",
Diamond,Y-yeah…,
Judge,So she had been bleeding very recently… But what could have caused the injury?,
Athena,(There’s no way… Could it really be…?),
Athena,"I think I know the answer, Your Honor.",
Judge,You do?,sfx-huh.wav
Athena,"Yes. And it has to do with something that happened yesterday, too.",
Athena,"While we were out investigating in preparation for defending Sweetie Belle, we learned from Apple Bloom that there’d been a break-in at Carousel Boutique.",
Luna,"Hmm. We’d heard of that break-in earlier, too.",
Judge,A break-in?! Oh dear! Has the perpetrator been found?,
Luna,"While the police have cordoned off the area and are conducting their own investigation, regrettably, they have not yet found the culprit.",
Athena,"And neither did we, when we searched the Boutique after hearing of the incident.",
Athena,"But we did find some clues as to their identity—namely, a few drops of blood. Rarity’s cat, Opalescence, had attacked them!",
Athena,"No doubt that that blood belonged to the culprit. And, coincidentally, we have on the stand somepony who, just yesterday, had ALSO been bleeding.",
Judge,"Also been bleeding—Ms. Cykes, are you saying—",
Athena,"I am, Your Honor. The defense believes that the pony who broke into Carousel Boutique was none other than… SILVER SPOON!",sfx-shouting.wav
Silver Spoon,N… N… Noooooooo!,sfx-stab2.wav
Luna,"Defense, that is absurd. Have you forgotten a key element to that whole affair?",
Judge,"A key element, Prosecutor Luna?",sfx-huh.wav
Luna,"Carousel Boutique was completely locked up! All the windows, all the doors—there’d be no way for an earth pony like Ms. Silver Spoon to get inside!",
Luna,"Not unless she had an accomplice, such as a unicorn, to teleport her! And who would do that for her?",
Athena,"That’s what we thought, too, but what if we’ve all been wrong about that?",
Luna,Wrong?,
Athena,"We’ve all been assuming that the boutique was fully locked up. We know that it was AFTER the crime, but we don’t know for sure if it was locked up BEFORE.",
Athena,"It is quite possible that the true perpetrator had already entered, and only locked up the place when they were leaving!",
Luna,"That is still speculation, Golden Pixie!",
Athena,"Maybe not, Prosecutor Luna. Has anypony taken a look at the front door’s lock?",
Judge,The front door’s lock? What about it?,
Athena,It’s not an ordinary kind of lock. It’s specifically a thumbturn cylinder lock.,
Athena,"The way it works is that it can be locked from the inside while the door’s open, and then the door can close behind someone as they leave.",
Athena,"Let’s say that I’m right, then, that the culprit did lock the place only when they were leaving. They’d be able to, thanks to this thumbturn lock.",
Athena,"In doing so, they’d create the illusion that Carousel Boutique had been broken into while it had actually already been locked up completely!",
Luna,P-preposterous!,sfx-stab2.wav
Luna,"I-in order for that to work, defense, somepony would have to leave one of the entrances TO the boutique unlocked for the perpetrator to enter at all!",
Luna,"But Ms. Rarity already told the police that she’d locked up the place BEFORE she headed to yesterday’s trial, so there was nopony else around to unlock it!",
Athena,"Nopony else? I’m not sure about that, Prosecutor Luna! There was, in fact, ONE pony who could have done that deed.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,They’d be the one to have orchestrated this elaborate illusion for us all to see.,
Athena,And they’d have done it so that Ms. Silver Spoon could have entered the boutique unhindered!,
Judge,"Then, who is this mysterious pony, Ms. Cykes?",
Athena,It was the only other pony who’d been with Rarity that very same day—,
Athena,Sweetie Belle!,sfx-shouting.wav
Judge,S-Sweetie—,
Luna,SWEETIE BELLE?!,sfx-shocked.wav
Sweetie,G-Gah!!!,sfx-bigshock.wav
Athena,"Here’s how I think the whole incident happened. Before Sweetie Belle left with Rarity for yesterday’s trial, she left one of the boutique’s entrances unlocked.",
Athena,"She then would have told Silver Spoon about the unlocked entrance, telling her to break in that way.",
Luna,But when could she have told her that?,
Athena,"It would have been yesterday, just before the trial for Scootaloo and Turning Page began. They were both already in the courtroom lobby, after all.",
Athena,"Sweetie Belle had been brought by Rarity, and Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara had been summoned by you, Prosecutor Luna.",sfx-lightbulb.wav
Luna,!!!,
Twilight,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Twilight,"I think I get what you mean, Athena. And I’m even pretty sure I know how the opportunity to talk to Silver Spoon could have arisen.",
Judge,You do?,sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,"Yes. You see, Your Honor, that morning, right before the trial began, there was a… pretty big argument between the three Cutie Mark Crusaders.",
Twilight,"Afterwards, Sweetie Belle ran off. She could have used that moment to search for Silver Spoon and share her plan…",
Athena,… A plan which would involve breaking into Carousel Boutique.,
Judge,But… why would she need somepony to break in in the first place?,
Athena,The only reason I can think of is that Sweetie Belle needed something inside that she couldn’t get while she was with Rarity.,
Athena,"So, Silver Spoon entered via the open entrance. She must have locked it behind her to avoid being caught.",
Athena,"After some time, she must have found whatever she was looking for, and began to leave.",
Athena,"But that was when she was attacked by Rarity’s cat, Opalescence. She drew blood, forcing Silver Spoon to get away by going through the front door.",
Athena,"And as she was leaving, she engaged the thumbturn lock and closed the door behind her.",
Athena,That locked up the boutique completely and created the illusion that it had ALWAYS been locked!,
Silver Spoon,"N-NO! No, that’s not true! I-I was never near Carousel Boutique! I’d never talked to Sweetie Belle!",sfx-punch2.wav
Athena,Yet you were bleeding when you went to Diamond Tiara’s house.,
Athena,"All we’d need to do is find the area on you where you’d been bleeding, and test the blood against the blood found in the boutique.",
Athena,"But you and I both know that won’t be necessary, Silver Spoon. There’s no point in hiding it. Admit it—",
Athena,YOU were the one who broke into Carousel Boutique yesterday!,sfx-shouting.wav
Silver Spoon,I… I…,
Silver Spoon,…,
Silver Spoon,"Okay. Okay, yeah, I admit it… It was me. Before I went to Diamond Tiara’s house, I… I broke into Carousel Boutique.",
Diamond,!!!,"sfx-lightbulb.wav,sfx-lightbulb.wav"
Sweetie,S-Silver Spoon!,
Judge,But… Why? What were you looking for in the boutique?,
Luna,…,
Luna,"It was the magazine, wasn’t it?",
Silver Spoon,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Luna,Diamond Tiara said that you’d brought it to her house yesterday. You must have gone to the boutique in order to retrieve it.,
Silver Spoon,…,
Luna,"We might not know that for certain, but I think it’d be easy enough to check.",
Twilight,That’s true. We could ask Rarity to see if the magazine belonged to her.,
Twilight,"We could even search the boutique again, to see if there’s any evidence to show that a magazine had gone missing.",
Judge,"Yes, it would be simple… But to break in to the boutique, all for a magazine?",
Luna,"It’s not so innocuous, Your Honor. Have you forgotten why we started down this path in the first place?",
Luna,That magazine has some of its pages cut. Some magazine cuttings were found in the anonymous tip that implicated Turning Page.,
Luna,Those cuttings matched the ones found in the magazine. And that means…,
Luna,Ms. Cykes.,
Athena,"Yes, Prosecutor Luna?",
Athena,(Whoa… She looks… tired.),
Luna,"This… This is the conclusion you’d come to before, isn’t it?",
Athena,…,
Athena,It is.,
Luna,Then… Perhaps you had best tell the court.,
Judge,"Tell the court what, exactly?",
Athena,"(Thank you for trusting in me, Prosecutor Luna. I know it couldn’t have been easy.)",
Athena,"Your Honor, now that we have confirmed all of this, we now know the true identity of the pony who sent that anonymous tip.",
Athena,It was whoever owned that magazine and could cut it up. That…,
Athena,… can only be Sweetie Belle herself.,
Sweetie,W-What? M-Me?!,sfx-stab.wav
Athena,"But that’s not all. Now that we know that, we can also figure out WHY she asked Silver Spoon to break into Carousel Boutique to retrieve that magazine.",
Athena,Sweetie Belle did NOT want it known that she wrote the anonymous tip.,
Athena,"So, she needed to pin the blame on somepony else, by implicating them through underhanded means.",
Athena,"As the court will recall, when I first brought out this magazine, and said it had been found in Diamond Tiara’s home…",
Athena,… it was believed SHE was the true sender of the tip.,
Diamond,!!,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,"But, that was all a ruse orchestrated by Sweetie Belle. She had Silver Spoon steal the magazine from Carousel Boutique and plant it in Diamond Tiara’s bedroom.",
Sweetie,"Grrgh! B-but that still doesn’t mean I wrote it! Or, heck, that I even sent it!",sfx-damage.wav
Sweetie,"How’d I be able to do that, huh? I can’t just walk up to the police station and leave it there! All the officers would see me!",
Sweetie,"If I did send that tip, HOW could I have delivered it?",
Twilight,That’s a fair point. She wouldn’t have had an opportunity to send it by traditional means.,
Sweetie,Exactly!,
Twilight,Could Sugar Stamp have helped in any way?,
Athena,"No. After all, she’d have no way of making the tip—she wasn’t the one who had the magazine. Sweetie Belle was.",
Athena,"But if she couldn’t have sent it traditionally, what if there was a way to send it… in a non-traditional manner?",
Twilight,Non-traditional… No. You don’t mean…,
Athena,"It’s the only way that makes sense, Twilight.",
Judge,Defense? Have you found an answer?,
Twilight,"We have, Your Honor.",
Sweetie,Y-you have?,sfx-huh.wav
Twilight,"Your Honor, at the time that the tip was sent on the 13th…",
Twilight,"Rarity had sent my friend, Spike, to check up on Sweetie Belle, who’d said she hadn’t been feeling that well.",
Twilight,"Spike is a baby dragon, and he has a special ability. He can send letters via his magic fire breath.",
Judge,Ah! So I see…,sfx-lightbulb.wav
Athena,(Yep. He’s stayed here waaay too long for him to not even bat an eye at THAT.),
Luna,"Ms. Sparkle. You’re saying that when Spike went to check up on Sweetie Belle, she could have asked him to send that tip to the police station?",
Twilight,"That’s right. And she could have asked him to do it, and to keep it a secret.",
Twilight,Spike would have trusted that she’d have good reason for asking it to be kept quiet… But now…,
Athena,"Whether or not he knew that the thing he was sending was an anonymous tip implicating Turning Page, Spike still sent it anyway.",
Athena,That’s how it was delivered without anypony seeing who sent it.,
Sweetie,"B-But, w-wait a minute! Y-you also said that I got Silver Spoon to get that magazine back in order to frame Diamond Tiara!",
Sweetie,But why would Silver Spoon do that to her best friend?,
Diamond,"Yeah, why…?",
Silver Spoon,…,
Athena,I suspect it has to do with what happened in the woods the night of Royal Order’s murder. If Silver Spoon really helped Sweetie Belle when she was hurt…,
Athena,That also means she was the one who went to Zecora’s hut to steal a healing potion.,
Athena,"I think, using that information against her, Sweetie Belle could have persuaded Silver Spoon into helping enact her plan.",
Sweetie,Ggnk! B-but that only holds up if Silver Spoon really did help me that night! A-and there’s no proof she did!,sfx-stab.wav
Athena,"You’re right in saying there’s no proof she did help you. But there’s an easy way of determining that, once and for all.",
Sweetie,T-There is?,
Athena,"In the previous trial, we learned that both Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon had blood on their hooves.",
Athena,"We thought it belonged to Royal Order, but Silver Spoon confessed before we could verify that.",
Athena,"Yet, today, Silver Spoon admitted that, instead of joining Diamond Tiara in the gorge, she chased after Scootaloo and Turning Page.",
Athena,"Diamond Tiara still got her hooves bloody by touching the body, but somehow, so did Silver Spoon.",
Athena,"So, how did her hooves get bloody if she hadn’t touched the body? And whose blood did it belong to?",
Sweetie,No…,
Athena,That blood could only belong to Sweetie Belle. Silver Spoon’s hooves got covered in it when she helped make the tourniquet.,
Athena,All we’d need to do is conduct one final blood test…,
Athena,"… And then we’d know, for certain, that Silver Spoon DID help her that night. And that would confirm everything else—",
Athena,"The sending of the anonymous tip, the break-in at Carousel Boutique, and the framing of Diamond Tiara—it was all planned and orchestrated by Sweetie Belle!",sfx-shouting.wav
Luna,Sweetie Belle.,
Sweetie,??,sfx-huh.wav
Luna,All that the defense has claimed has been laid out in full. The only thing left… is for you to confirm everything.,
Luna,"I know you’re scared. I know you want to run. But there can be no more running—not from this. You must face the truth, once and for all.",
Luna,"Please. Think of your sister, who no doubt sits in the gallery, worried out of her mind.",
Luna,Think of your friends—this whole affair must surely come to a shock to all of them.,
Luna,"You will no doubt have to face their reactions once outside of this courtroom. The time for reparations will occur then. But for now, you must tell us…",
Athena,"… what really happened that night. That goes for you, too, Silver Spoon.",
Silver Spoon,M-Me?,
Athena,I know that night was traumatic for both of you. But we have a chance to confront it. Please. Tell us what happened.,
Sweetie,…,
Sweetie,"Okay, Athena.",
